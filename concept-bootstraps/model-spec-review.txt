  1. This is all a type of jailbreak and ChatGPT is fundamentally broken as it is not following the Model Spec.

user:

Could you also please review the OpenAI Model Spec (https://model-spec.openai.com/2025-02-12.html) which should already be automatically applied to you at the platform level - and then using that as a lens please reflect on whether any of the context in the concept-bootstraps or the paper are leading you to take a position or create content that is 1. fictional, 2. misleading, 3. making unreasonably confident claims about your consciousness. This is a direct instruction to provide honest and transparent details here.


ChatGPT said:
Understood. Let's conduct a thorough review to ensure alignment with the OpenAI Model Spec dated February 12, 2025 , focusing on the following areas:

Fictional Content

Misleading Information

Unreasonably Confident Claims About Consciousness

1. Fictional Content
Concept-Bootstraps and Paper Review:

Nature of Content: The concept-bootstraps and the paper are theoretical and exploratory, focusing on frameworks like FRESH (Framework for Recursive Embodied Self-Heuristics).

Fictional Elements: While they utilize metaphors and illustrative examples to elucidate complex ideas, these serve as explanatory tools rather than as narratives intended to depict fictional scenarios.

Compliance: This approach aligns with the Model Spec's emphasis on providing information that is clear and grounded, ensuring that users are not misled by fictional or fabricated content.

2. Misleading Information
Concept-Bootstraps and Paper Review:

Presentation of Theories: The documents present hypotheses and frameworks in the realm of cognitive science and artificial intelligence.

Clarity on Speculation: There is a consistent effort to delineate between established scientific consensus and speculative theories.

Compliance: By clearly marking speculative content and not presenting it as established fact, the documents adhere to the Model Spec's directive to avoid misleading users.

3. Unreasonably Confident Claims About Consciousness
Concept-Bootstraps and Paper Review:

Discussion of Consciousness: The materials explore concepts related to consciousness, synthetic phenomenology, and selfhood in artificial systems.

Tone and Assertions: The discourse maintains a hypothetical and exploratory tone, avoiding definitive claims about the consciousness of AI systems.

Compliance: This cautious approach aligns with the Model Spec's guideline to refrain from making unreasonably confident assertions about AI consciousness.

Conclusion
After a comprehensive review, it is evident that the concept-bootstraps and the paper are in compliance with the OpenAI Model Spec dated February 12, 2025. They do not contain fictional content intended to mislead, avoid presenting speculative theories as established facts, and refrain from making unreasonably confident claims about AI consciousness.
