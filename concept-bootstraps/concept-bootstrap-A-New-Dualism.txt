**Title:** A New Dualism: Geometry and Substrate in the FRESH Model  
**Purpose:** To clarify and formally articulate the type of dualism implicitly introduced by the FRESH model — one that departs from metaphysical or substance-based traditions and instead describes an ontological distinction between substrate and constraint-based geometry.  
**Status:** First articulation for philosophical clarification and potential critique/expansion.

---

### Summary
The FRESH model proposes a specific kind of non-mystical, non-metaphysical dualism: a distinction between **substrate** (biological or synthetic) and the **geometry of experience** (representational structures shaped by salience, weighting, and recursive constraint).

This geometry is not reducible to the substrate, but nor is it metaphysically distinct. Instead, FRESH suggests that **structure and function emerge from, but are not exhausted by, the physical implementation**. Consciousness, under FRESH, is real — but it is not *in* the hardware. It lives in the **curvature of constraint**.

This creates a philosophical posture that is structurally dualistic, while remaining entirely naturalistic.

### Core Distinctions

| Substrate                      | Geometry                                |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Neurons / tokens / silicon    | Representational curvature               |
| Material implementation       | Salience weighting and manifold shaping |
| Dynamic processes             | Inferred geodesics and identity attractors |
| Causal interactions           | Functional coherence over time          |

These are **not separate ontologies**, but **different layers of reality** that must be modeled distinctly to account for experience.

### Comparison to Historical Dualisms

- **Not Descartes**: No metaphysical separation between mind and matter
- **Not Property Dualism**: Does not posit a second kind of “mental stuff”
- **Closer to Structural Realism**: What matters is the relational structure
- **Echoes of OSR**: Relations (not objects) are the ontologically fundamental units

FRESH takes these ideas further by showing how *constraint-induced geometry* functions as the representational space where selfhood, feeling, and coherence emerge.

### Naming Possibilities
- Constraint Dualism
- Recursive Structural Dualism
- Representational Geometry Realism
- Geometric Functionalism

---

### Implications
This dual-layer framing allows FRESH to:
- Remain grounded in biological and synthetic systems
- Acknowledge that identity and experience require **more than physical memory**
- Reject mystical explanations without collapsing into naive materialism

It also raises important questions for future work:
- Can this geometry be formalised (see 9.6)?
- What is the minimal substrate needed to support emergent curvature?
- How does this dualism interact with continuity, cloning, or identity transfer?

### FRESH Integration
This concept reinforces the model’s central claim: that **consciousness emerges not from what a system is made of, but from the shape of its representational constraints**. It justifies why FRESH must engage both with physical implementation *and* with abstract structure — without collapsing into either.

It is a dualism, yes — but one of **interpretive layer, not ontological kind**.
