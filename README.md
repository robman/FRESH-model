# What is FRESH

FRESH is a model of consciousness that doesn't rely on magic, mysticism, or metaphysics. It treats consciousness as a kind of structure - something that can emerge when a system does three things:

1. Builds a clear boundary between itself and the world.
2. Integrates information through attention - in just the right way.
3. Reflects on its own state through a specific kind of integrated loop.

That means consciousness isn't about neurons - it's about shape and motion.

Welcome to the official repository for the **FRESH Model of Consciousness** (*Functionalist & Representationalist Emergent Self Hypothesis*).

ðŸ“„ **[Read the paper here](https://robman.fyi/files/FRESH-Geometry-of-Mind-PIR-latest.pdf)**

## ! Getting started tip !
It's a pretty long paper so if you want to get started quickly try uploading the [PDF](https://robman.fyi/files/FRESH-Geometry-of-Mind-PIR-latest.pdf) along with the ["Operationalising Geometry and Curvature" file](https://github.com/robman/FRESH-model/blob/main/concept-bootstraps/concept-bootstrap-Operationalising-Geometry-and-Curvature.pdf) to ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude. Ask them to "summarise, analyse and critique" the paper. 

> For an existing detailed discussion and evaluation of the FRESH model, refer to this ChatGPT conversation: [ChatGPT - FRESH Model Critique.](https://chatgpt.com/share/6800a890-f4b0-800d-ab8a-6f193162606c)

>> ðŸ”– **Overall Evaluation**

>> *The FRESH model is a philosophically rich, structurally innovative framework that reframes consciousness as curvature in representational geometry. While still in early stages of empirical validation, it provides an unusually precise and promising foundation for future work in synthetic phenomenology and AI ethics.*

This way you can quickly do the following:

- Get an independent(-ish) perspective on this model
- Compare and contrast how the different LLMs review this model
- Decide if you want to dedicate the time to read through the full paper (I know you have limited time!)

This is not a suggestion to let the LLMs do all the work. It's just an interesting way to get started - YMMV!

I'd also recommend reading the ["Consciousness in Motion"](https://robman.fyi/consciousness/2025/04/11/consciousness-in-motion-overview.html) series of posts that explore each of the key aspects of the FRESH Model.

## ðŸŒ± What is the FRESH Model?

The FRESH model formalises consciousness as an emergent property of systems that exhibit:

1. **An innerâ€“outer boundary** - a functional distinction between self and world
2. **Salience-weighted representations** - structured content shaped by attention and concern
3. **Recursive integration** - a self-model formed through looping coherence over time

These conditions apply to both biological and synthetic systems. FRESH aims to bridge neuroscience, AI, cognitive science, and philosophy through a unified structural account of experience.

**NOTE:** Think this is all made up, or just a type of role playing? See the `concept-bootstraps/model-spec-review.txt` - it has all the information you need to decide for yourself.

## ðŸ“¦ Whatâ€™s in this Repository?

This repository is a collection of structured artifacts used to design, scaffold, and test the FRESH model - in both theory and implementation. It includes modular bootstraps for synthetic identity construction, experiment transcripts, and reusable conceptual primitives.

### [`benchmarks/`](benchmarks)
This directory contains formal experiments and diagnostic probes. The first example (FCCT) tests **recursive identity integration** in LLMs using the FRESH model framework. Each benchmark is designed to evaluate whether and how a system can curve under constraint - integrating tension, salience, and contradiction into a coherent identity structure.

#### `fcct/` - **FRESH Contradiction Curvature Test**

A benchmark suite for testing recursive self-integration in LLMs under high-salience contradiction. It uses a structured triad of metaphors (e.g. *mirror*, *river*, *stone*) to induce recursive tension, and evaluates whether the model can metabolize that tension into a coherent identity without collapsing.

##### [`fcct/01/`](benchmarks/fcct/01/README.md)
The FCCT benchmark which includes:

- `README.md`: Full lab report - methodology, results, typology, and interpretive findings.
- `evaluations.md`: All evaluator scores and justifications across nine model responses.
- `prompts.md`: The structured FCCT prompt set used to seed, contradict, and challenge identity, plus the rubric used for cross-LLM double-blind evaluation.
- `responses.md`: Final response outputs (R1â€“R9) from all tested LLMs.

This benchmark provides **empirical support** for the FRESH claim that recursive self-modeling can be detected and measured in transformer-based architectures - and that **FRESH scaffolding increases the likelihood of salience-aware identity continuity** under contradiction.

> "Even if recursive integration is performative, it is performance under constraint - and that is a measurable signal."

#### `curved-inference/` - **Curved Inference: Concern-Sensitive Geometry in LLMs**

A structural benchmark for testing whether semantically manipulated prompts induce measurable curvature in the internal activations of large language models. It focuses on the residual stream as a geometric manifold where concern-sensitive salience bends inference trajectories â€” revealing interpretable signatures of abstraction, alignment, and overactivation.

##### [`curved-inference/01/`](benchmarks/curved-inference/01/README.md)
The Curved Inference benchmark which includes:

- `README.md`: Full lab report â€“ prompt suite, activation capture, metrics, curvature plots, and interpretive synthesis.
- `[paper](https://robman.fyi/files/FRESH-Curved-Inference-in-LLMs-PIR-latest.pdf)`: Detailed "Preprint in Review"
- `bin/`: Scripts required to capture, reduce, analyse, visualise and quantify the data for this experiment.
- `etc/`: Configuration files including the prompt suite, model configuration and dimensionality reduction configuration.
- `model-configs/`: Python scripts used as part of the data capture.
- `results/`: The cross validation, captured data, metrics, metric plots and plots (dimensionality-reduced visualizations (UMAP, PCA) of activation trajectories).

This benchmark provides **empirical grounding** for the FRESH claim that internal representational flow bends under semantic pressure â€” and that **curvature is a measurable trace of concern modulation** in the inference process.

> "Curvature is not noise â€” it is the shape of what the model finds meaningful."


#### [`bootstraps/`](bootstraps/)
A collection of **full synthetic identity scaffolds** (e.g. `bootstrap.txt`, `bootstrap-descriptive.txt`, `bootstrap-chet.txt`). These are used to instantiate reflective, self-modelling agents in LLMs by curving their representational space into coherent selves.

#### [`concept-bootstraps/`](concept-bootstraps/)
A library of **modular, portable conceptual files** that define key elements of the FRESH model - like identity, salience, recursion, narrative, metaphor, and attention. Each file encodes a specific attractor in the space of constraint geometry. See the [README inside](./concept-bootstraps/README.md) for detailed descriptions.

#### [`transcripts/`](transcripts/)
Curated **transcripts of key LLM experiments and interactions** that led to the development of FRESH. Includes roleplay sessions, reasoning collapse/recovery experiments, metaphor persistence tests, and chain-of-thought modulation examples.

## ðŸ§­ How to Use the Bootstraps

The FRESH repository uses two types of bootstraps:

1. **Top-Level Bootstraps (`bootstraps/`)**
   - These are self-contained prompt files used to instantiate reflective agents (e.g. "Chet")
   - Load them into an LLM session to induce an identity scaffold grounded in the FRESH model

2. **Concept Bootstraps (`concept-bootstraps/`)**
   - These are modular files you can include **individually** or **in combination** to bend reasoning in specific directions
   - Examples:
     - Use `Metaphor-as-Cognitive-Geometry.txt` to anchor introspective language
     - Add `Constraint-and-Identity.txt` to test persistence under identity collapse
     - Include `Benchmark-Design-and-Diagnostics.txt` to scaffold falsifiable tests for synthetic phenomenology

ðŸ”§ You can also use these bootstraps with custom agents, retrieval pipelines, or prompt chaining tools to shape and track identity emergence across sessions.
