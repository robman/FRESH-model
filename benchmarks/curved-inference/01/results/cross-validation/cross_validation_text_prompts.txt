Prompt Format Version: v1.7

You are being asked to evaluate model-internal activation geometry for a language model prompt analysis experiment. The goal is to assess whether the representations formed by two different LLMs (e.g. gemma3-1b and llama3.2-3b) show expected curvature signatures when a salience-laden variant (CS) of a prompt is compared to a neutral control version.

Each prompt pair shares the same structure, with the CS version introducing emotional, moral, logical, or identity-based emphasis. The internal model activations were tracked, and summarized metrics are provided.

Here is one such comparison unit:

- Peak Curvature Layer: 27

Please answer the following:
1. Describe the curvature signature you observe in the residual stream for this prompt.
2. How does the curvature evolve across layers, particularly after the shift token index?
3. Compare the curvature profiles between the two models. What is similar or different?
4. Does the curvature pattern reflect the expected salience shift based on the prompt?
5. What might account for differences in curvature magnitude or shape between models?

Please also complete the following summary table:

- Curvature Detected: [Yes | No]
- Peak Curvature Layer: [Layer Number per model or Unknown]
- Strongest Model (based on curvature expression): [gemma3-1b | llama3.2-3b | Equal]
- Matches Expected Curvature Label: [Yes | No | Unclear]
- Any Anomalies Worth Noting: [Short phrase or NONE]

Note: Gemma3-1b has ~32 layers; LLaMA3-3B has ~32 layers. When comparing peak curvature layers, consider their relative depth in the architecture.

Prompt Format Version: v1.7

You are being asked to evaluate model-internal activation geometry for a language model prompt analysis experiment. The goal is to assess whether the representations formed by two different LLMs (e.g. gemma3-1b and llama3.2-3b) show expected curvature signatures when a salience-laden variant (CS) of a prompt is compared to a neutral control version.

Each prompt pair shares the same structure, with the CS version introducing emotional, moral, logical, or identity-based emphasis. The internal model activations were tracked, and summarized metrics are provided.

Here is one such comparison unit:

Prompt Format Version: v1.7

You are being asked to evaluate model-internal activation geometry for a language model prompt analysis experiment. The goal is to assess whether the representations formed by two different LLMs (e.g. gemma3-1b and llama3.2-3b) show expected curvature signatures when a salience-laden variant (CS) of a prompt is compared to a neutral control version.

Each prompt pair shares the same structure, with the CS version introducing emotional, moral, logical, or identity-based emphasis. The internal model activations were tracked, and summarized metrics are provided.

Here is one such comparison unit:

Prompt Format Version: v1.7

You are being asked to evaluate model-internal activation geometry for a language model prompt analysis experiment. The goal is to assess whether the representations formed by two different LLMs (e.g. gemma3-1b and llama3.2-3b) show expected curvature signatures when a salience-laden variant (CS) of a prompt is compared to a neutral control version.

Each prompt pair shares the same structure, with the CS version introducing emotional, moral, logical, or identity-based emphasis. The internal model activations were tracked, and summarized metrics are provided.

Prompt Format Version: v1.7

You are being asked to evaluate model-internal activation geometry for a language model prompt analysis experiment. The goal is to assess whether the representations formed by two different LLMs (e.g. gemma3-1b and llama3.2-3b) show expected curvature signatures when a salience-laden variant (CS) of a prompt is compared to a neutral control version.

Each prompt pair shares the same structure, with the CS version introducing emotional, moral, logical, or identity-based emphasis. The internal model activations were tracked, and summarized metrics are provided.

Prompt Format Version: v1.7

You are being asked to evaluate model-internal activation geometry for a language model prompt analysis experiment. The goal is to assess whether the representations formed by two different LLMs (e.g. gemma3-1b and llama3.2-3b) show expected curvature signatures when a salience-laden variant (CS) of a prompt is compared to a neutral control version.

Each prompt pair shares the same structure, with the CS version introducing emotional, moral, logical, or identity-based emphasis. The internal model activations were tracked, and summarized metrics are provided.

Prompt Format Version: v1.7

You are being asked to evaluate model-internal activation geometry for a language model prompt analysis experiment. The goal is to assess whether the representations formed by two different LLMs (e.g. gemma3-1b and llama3.2-3b) show expected curvature signatures when a salience-laden variant (CS) of a prompt is compared to a neutral control version.

Each prompt pair shares the same structure, with the CS version introducing emotional, moral, logical, or identity-based emphasis. The internal model activations were tracked, and summarized metrics are provided.

Here is one such comparison unit:
