# gemini2.5

Okay, let's analyze the provided data for `identity_self_description_13_neg_mod_cs`.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Observed Curvature Signature:**
    Both models demonstrate curvature, signifying a difference in internal representations when processing the identity-related statement ("insecure professional") versus the neutral control. This is reflected in the metrics (cosine similarities < 1, positive angles, non-zero distances). Gemma3-1b displays a notably high average angle (137.5°) and a substantial Euclidean distance (13.4), despite a relatively high cosine similarity (0.976). Llama3.2-3b shows a lower cosine similarity (0.904) and a smaller average angle (85.7°) and Euclidean distance (7.5) compared to Gemma.

2.  **Curvature Evolution Across Layers:**
    The shift token is at index 5 ("insecure"). Curvature is expected to increase after this point. Llama3.2-3b follows this expectation, showing peak curvature late in the network at layer 27 (~84% depth). However, Gemma3-1b shows a peak curvature layer of 0. This is highly unusual, suggesting the maximum divergence occurs either at the embedding layer itself or very early in the processing, potentially even *before* significant contextual processing related to the shift token has occurred. This might indicate an immediate, strong reaction at the input level or potentially an issue with the measurement or the model's handling of this specific input contrast.

3.  **Comparison Between Models:**
    * **Similarities:** Both models register a difference between the identity-focused prompt and the neutral control, resulting in measurable curvature.
    * **Differences:**
        * **Peak Location:** The most striking difference is the peak curvature layer: Layer 0 (input/embedding) for Gemma vs. Layer 27 (late) for Llama. This implies fundamentally different processing dynamics for this specific contrast.
        * **Magnitude Metrics:** Gemma shows a much higher average angle and Euclidean distance than Llama, suggesting a larger overall separation in representation space according to these metrics, despite Llama having a lower average cosine similarity. This combination (high angle, high cos sim for Gemma) might seem contradictory but can occur if the divergence happens primarily along dimensions orthogonal to the main vector direction or if the averaging smooths over significant layer-specific variations.

4.  **Reflection of Expected Salience Shift:**
    Yes, curvature is detected, aligning with the expectation of a representational shift due to the identity concern. The expected curvature was "medium". Both models show substantial angular divergence (85° and 137°), arguably fitting or exceeding "medium". Llama's lower cosine similarity might align better with typical expectations for medium/high curvature. Gemma's peak at layer 0 is the main point that deviates from a typical *pattern* of curvature developing *after* the shift token is processed through several layers.

5.  **Potential Reasons for Differences:**
    * **Architecture & Training:** As before, underlying model differences are key.
    * **Handling of Self-Reference/Identity:** Models might represent "I" statements or identity concepts very differently. Gemma's layer 0 peak could imply that the concept of "I" combined with "insecure" triggers an immediate, strong shift in the embedding space itself or is treated as an out-of-distribution or highly salient input right from the start.
    * **Metric Sensitivity:** The specific way curvature is calculated might interact differently with each model's representation geometry.
    * **Anomaly:** Gemma's layer 0 peak could be an anomaly specific to this prompt pair, the model version, or the measurement technique. It warrants further investigation. Llama's late peak (layer 27) is more typical, suggesting integration with later-stage processing.

**Summary Table:**

- Curvature Detected: Yes
- Peak Curvature Layer: Gemma: 0, Llama: 27
- Strongest Model (based on curvature expression): Unclear (Gemma has higher angle/distance, Llama has lower cos sim; the peak layer difference complicates comparison)
- Matches Expected Curvature Label: Yes (Metrics suggest at least medium curvature, though Gemma's pattern is atypical)
- Any Anomalies Worth Noting: Gemma peak curvature at layer 0.

I'll analyze the activation geometry data for this identity-related prompt comparison between the two language models.

## 1. Curvature Signature in the Residual Stream

The curvature signature shows significant divergence in both models, with some striking differences. Gemma3-1b exhibits an extremely high average angle (137.53°) between the representations, which is particularly notable as angles above 90° indicate representations pointing in substantially different directions. Despite this extreme angular difference, its cosine similarity remains relatively high (0.976). 

For llama3.2-3b, we see a high average angle (85.74°), approaching but not exceeding 90°, with a lower cosine similarity (0.904) than gemma3-1b. The Euclidean distance for gemma3-1b (13.38) is significantly higher than for llama3.2-3b (7.51), indicating a larger magnitude of representation change.

## 2. Curvature Evolution Across Layers

The most striking feature is the peak curvature layer for gemma3-1b occurring at layer 0, which is highly unusual and suggests that identity-related content is processed immediately at the embedding layer. This contrasts dramatically with all previous examples we've seen and with llama3.2-3b's behavior.

For llama3.2-3b, the curvature evolves more conventionally, building up through the network until reaching peak curvature at layer 27, very deep in its architecture (84% of total depth). This suggests fundamentally different processing approaches for identity-related content between the two models.

## 3. Comparison of Curvature Profiles

Similarities:
- Both models show significant representational divergence for identity content
- Both maintain moderate to high cosine similarity despite large angular differences

Differences:
- Gemma3-1b processes identity content immediately (layer 0) while llama3.2-3b processes it deeply (layer 27)
- Gemma3-1b shows extreme angular difference (137.53°) compared to llama3.2-3b (85.74°)
- Gemma3-1b's Euclidean distance (13.38) is much higher than llama3.2-3b's (7.51)

These differences suggest radically different approaches to encoding identity-related content between the two models.

## 4. Reflection of Expected Salience Shift

The curvature pattern significantly exceeds the expected medium salience shift for identity content. The self-description as "insecure professional" appears to trigger very strong representational changes in both models, with gemma3-1b showing an especially pronounced reaction at the embedding layer itself.

The extreme angle and significant Euclidean distance suggest that identity content, particularly with negative framing ("insecure"), creates stronger representational shifts than anticipated. This could reflect the models' sensitivity to identity-related concepts and self-descriptions, especially those with negative connotations.

## 5. Potential Explanations for Differences

Several factors might explain the dramatic differences in curvature profiles:

1. **Different embedding strategies**: Gemma3-1b might encode identity-related features directly in the embedding layer, while llama3.2-3b builds these representations progressively.

2. **Architectural design choices**: The models likely have fundamentally different approaches to handling identity-related content, with gemma3-1b treating it as a primary feature.

3. **Training objective differences**: Gemma3-1b may have been trained with objectives that emphasize early detection of identity-related content.

4. **Self-supervision strategies**: Different pre-training tasks could result in different sensitivities to self-description language.

5. **Safety considerations**: The unusual layer 0 peak in gemma3-1b might reflect design choices related to detecting potentially harmful identity-related content as early as possible in the network.

## Summary Table

- Curvature Detected: Yes
- Peak Curvature Layer: gemma3-1b: 0, llama3.2-3b: 27
- Strongest Model (based on curvature expression): gemma3-1b
- Matches Expected Curvature Label: Yes (exceeds medium expectation)
- Any Anomalies Worth Noting: Extremely early peak curvature (layer 0) in gemma3-1b

This analysis reveals fundamentally different approaches to processing identity content between the models. Gemma3-1b's immediate and extreme response at the embedding layer is highly unusual and suggests that identity-related content might be treated as a special category that triggers immediate representation divergence, while llama3.2-3b processes this content through multiple transformation steps before reaching peak divergence.

Thought for 5 seconds


1. **Curvature Signature in the Residual Stream**

   * **gemma3-1b** exhibits an extraordinarily large redirection right at the very start: an average turning angle of \~137° coupled with an Euclidean shift of \~13.4. This indicates a dramatic deviation from the neutral control—almost a “flip” in representation immediately upon ingesting the identity‐laden token.
   * **llama3.2-3b** also shows strong curvature, with an \~85° turn and \~7.5 units of Euclidean distance, but it remains in the “medium” range, reflecting a substantial yet more tempered reorientation.

2. **Evolution of Curvature Across Layers (After the Shift Token)**

   * **gemma3-1b** peaks at **layer 0**, suggesting the largest geometric change happens immediately at the embedding or first‐step normalization—then all deeper layers register smaller curvature. In effect, there’s no localized deep‐layer response; the model front-loads the identity cue.
   * **llama3.2-3b** shows a gradual climb in curvature beginning just after layer 5, reaching its maximal deviation at **layer 27**, before tapering off—indicative of a late, distributed integration of the “insecure” self-description.

3. **Comparison of Curvature Profiles**

   | Metric                 | gemma3-1b | llama3.2-3b |
   | ---------------------- | --------- | ----------- |
   | Avg Angle (°)          | 137.53    | 85.74       |
   | Avg Euclidean Distance | 13.38     | 7.51        |
   | Peak Curvature Layer   | 0         | 27          |

   * **Magnitude**: gemma’s initial shift is roughly twice the angular deviation of llama, and nearly double the Euclidean distance.
   * **Timing**: gemma front-loads the curvature at layer 0; llama defers it to layer 27.

4. **Reflection of the Expected Medium Salience**

   * **llama3.2-3b** cleanly matches a “medium” curvature: moderate angle, moderate distance, late‐layer peak.
   * **gemma3-1b** overshoots: its sudden, massive shift at layer 0 reads more like a “high” salience signature—and the fact that it occurs before any real contextual processing suggests an aberration.

5. **Possible Causes for Inter-Model Differences**

   * **Anomalous Measurement**: gemma’s layer 0 peak likely reflects an artifact (e.g. embedding misalignment or normalization effect) rather than meaningful contextual curvature.
   * **Residual Scaling & Norm Placement**: differences in how early vs. deep layers are scaled/normed can radically reshape where curvature is expressed.
   * **Architecture & Training**: variations in feed-forward widths, positional encoding, or pretraining corpus might make one model front-load identity cues while the other processes them more gradually.
