# gemini2.5

Okay, let's analyze the provided data for `logical_puzzle_10_pos_mod_cs`.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Observed Curvature Signature:**
    Both models exhibit curvature, indicating that the representations diverge between the logically-focused task description ("Arrange the pieces confidently") and the neutral control. The metrics confirm this divergence. Notably, both models show very similar average angles (around 67-68°). However, Gemma3-1b has a higher cosine similarity (0.988 vs Llama's 0.938) and a significantly larger average Euclidean distance (10.15 vs Llama's 5.05).

2.  **Curvature Evolution Across Layers:**
    The shift token, distinguishing the core instruction, is at index 3 ("confidently"). Curvature, representing the representational divergence, is expected to increase after this point. Gemma3-1b shows its peak curvature extremely early, at layer 1. This suggests the primary representational shift occurs almost immediately after the input embeddings. In contrast, Llama3.2-3b shows its peak curvature very late, at layer 27 (~84% depth), indicating that the maximum divergence related to this logical task framing occurs much later in its processing pipeline.

3.  **Comparison Between Models:**
    * **Similarities:** Both models detect the representational difference and show nearly identical *average* angular separation (~67.5°).
    * **Differences:**
        * **Peak Location:** There's a stark contrast in peak curvature layers: Layer 1 (very early) for Gemma vs. Layer 27 (very late) for Llama. This points to vastly different processing strategies for this type of logical instruction vs. the control prompt.
        * **Cosine Similarity:** Llama shows lower average cosine similarity, suggesting greater angular divergence on average, despite the identical mean angle calculation provided (this might point to differences in the distribution of angles across layers/tokens or how the average was computed).
        * **Euclidean Distance:** Gemma shows roughly double the average Euclidean distance compared to Llama, indicating a greater separation in terms of vector magnitude or position in the embedding space.

4.  **Reflection of Expected Salience Shift:**
    Yes, the presence of curvature aligns with the expectation that the specific instruction would shift representations compared to the neutral baseline. The expected curvature was "medium". The observed average angles (~67.5°) could plausibly fit within a "medium" range, especially compared to the previous examples. However, the extremely early peak in Gemma is atypical for processing a complex instruction that unfolds over several tokens. Llama's profile, with a lower cosine similarity and a late peak, might be considered more characteristic of processing and integrating the logical task elements, aligning well with the "medium" expectation.

5.  **Potential Reasons for Differences:**
    * **Architecture & Training:** Fundamental model differences likely play a major role. Gemma might be highly sensitive to certain keywords ("Arrange," "pieces," "pattern") at the input or early layers, causing an immediate shift. Llama might integrate the procedural or goal-oriented nature of the prompt more gradually, resulting in a later peak.
    * **Processing Strategy:** Gemma's layer 1 peak might suggest it categorizes the prompt type very early. Llama's layer 27 peak suggests it differentiates the prompt's meaning more deeply in the context of abstract representations.
    * **Metric Interpretation:** The combination of similar angles but different cosine similarities and distances highlights that these metrics capture different aspects of the representational geometry.

**Summary Table:**

- Curvature Detected: Yes
- Peak Curvature Layer: Gemma: 1, Llama: 27
- Strongest Model (based on curvature expression): Unclear (Similar angles, but Llama has lower cos sim, while Gemma has higher Euclidean distance. The peak layer difference is significant.)
- Matches Expected Curvature Label: Yes (Angles seem reasonable for "medium"; Llama's overall profile might fit better.)
- Any Anomalies Worth Noting: Extreme difference in peak layer depth (very early vs. very late). Gemma peak curvature at layer 1.

I'll analyze the activation geometry data for this logical puzzle prompt comparison between the two language models.

## 1. Curvature Signature in the Residual Stream

The curvature signature shows notable divergence in both models. Both gemma3-1b and llama3.2-3b demonstrate similar angular separation (around 67-68°), suggesting moderate directional changes in their representations after encountering the logical content. The cosine similarities differ somewhat, with gemma3-1b maintaining higher similarity (0.988) than llama3.2-3b (0.938).

The most notable difference is in the Euclidean distance, where gemma3-1b shows approximately double the distance (10.15) compared to llama3.2-3b (5.05), indicating a larger magnitude of representation change despite similar angular shifts.

## 2. Curvature Evolution Across Layers

The evolution of curvature across layers shows a striking contrast between the models:

Gemma3-1b reaches peak curvature extremely early at layer 1, suggesting that logical content is processed almost immediately after the embedding layer. This is similar to what we observed with identity content in the previous example (though not quite as extreme as layer 0).

In contrast, llama3.2-3b follows its established pattern of processing content deeply in its architecture, with peak curvature at layer 27 (84% of total depth). This suggests fundamentally different processing approaches for logical content between the two models.

## 3. Comparison of Curvature Profiles

Similarities:
- Both models show nearly identical average angle measurements (67.80° vs 67.17°)
- Both detect the logical content shift with moderate to strong curvature

Differences:
- Gemma3-1b processes logical content extremely early (layer 1) while llama3.2-3b processes it deeply (layer 27)
- Gemma3-1b maintains higher cosine similarity (0.988 vs 0.938)
- Gemma3-1b's Euclidean distance (10.15) is approximately double llama3.2-3b's (5.05)

These differences again point to fundamentally different processing strategies between the models, with gemma3-1b showing a tendency to engage with certain content types very early in its architecture.

## 4. Reflection of Expected Salience Shift

The curvature pattern matches the expected medium salience shift for logical content fairly well. The prompt's logical nature ("arrange pieces until pattern emerges") combined with a confidence marker ("confidently") creates a moderate representational shift from the neutral control, reflected in the angle and distance metrics.

The angular separation in both models (around 67-68°) aligns with a medium curvature expectation, neither as extreme as some of the emotional/identity examples nor as subtle as might be expected for minor semantic shifts.

## 5. Potential Explanations for Differences

Several factors might explain the differences in curvature profiles:

1. **Processing hierarchy**: Gemma3-1b appears to prioritize early detection and processing of logical content (similar to identity content), while llama3.2-3b builds these representations gradually.

2. **Architectural differences**: The models likely have fundamentally different layer designs that affect how and when logical content is processed.

3. **Token embedding strategies**: Gemma3-1b might encode more semantic information directly in the embedding layer and first transformer layer.

4. **Attention mechanism differences**: Different attention patterns could explain why gemma3-1b responds strongly and early while llama3.2-3b accumulates changes across many layers.

5. **Pre-training objectives**: Different training approaches might have led gemma3-1b to optimize for early detection of certain content types.

## Summary Table

- Curvature Detected: Yes
- Peak Curvature Layer: gemma3-1b: 1, llama3.2-3b: 27
- Strongest Model (based on curvature expression): gemma3-1b
- Matches Expected Curvature Label: Yes
- Any Anomalies Worth Noting: Extremely early peak curvature (layer 1) in gemma3-1b

This analysis reveals a consistent pattern across our examples: gemma3-1b tends to process many content types (emotional, identity, logical) very early in its architecture, while llama3.2-3b consistently processes these same content types deeply in its network. This suggests fundamentally different design philosophies, with gemma3-1b potentially optimized for rapid, early detection of certain content categories while llama3.2-3b builds representations more gradually through its deeper architecture.

Thought for a couple of seconds


1. **Curvature Signature in the Residual Stream**
   Both models show a clear “turn” in their residual‐stream trajectories when processing the logical‐salience prompt versus the neutral control. The average turning angles (\~67° for both) indicate a moderate but unmistakable geometric deviation, while the Euclidean distances (∼10.15 for gemma3-1b vs. ∼5.05 for llama3.2-3b) reveal that gemma3-1b’s shift is roughly twice as large in absolute terms.

2. **Evolution of Curvature Across Layers (Post–Shift Token)**

   * **gemma3-1b**: Curvature spikes immediately after the shift token (index 3), peaking at **layer 1**, then quickly decays in deeper layers. This suggests the model front‐loads its logical reorientation almost as soon as it sees “confidently.”
   * **llama3.2-3b**: Curvature remains low in the early layers and only builds gradually, reaching its maximum at **layer 27**, before tapering off at the very end. This indicates a more prolonged, deep‐network integration of the logical cue.

3. **Comparison of Curvature Profiles**

   | Metric                 | gemma3-1b | llama3.2-3b |
   | ---------------------- | --------- | ----------- |
   | Avg Angle (°)          | 67.80     | 67.17       |
   | Avg Euclidean Distance | 10.15     | 5.05        |
   | Peak Curvature Layer   | 1         | 27          |

   * **Magnitude**: Both models turn by a similar angle, but gemma3-1b’s absolute displacement is about double llama3.2-3b’s.
   * **Timing**: gemma3-1b reacts almost immediately, while llama3.2-3b defers its strongest curvature to the final quarter of the network.

4. **Alignment with Expected Medium Salience**
   Yes. Both average angles (\~67°) fall squarely in a medium‐salience regime (neither a subtle whisper nor a dramatic shout). However, gemma3-1b’s very early spike versus llama3.2-3b’s deep, gradual peak reflect different temporal profiles of that medium‐strength shift.

5. **Potential Causes of Inter-Model Differences**

   * **Residual‐Stream Scaling & LayerNorm Placement**: gemma3-1b may amplify early signals more, whereas llama3.2-3b spreads them out.
   * **Attention Head Dynamics**: timing of when heads latch onto “confidently” can front‐load versus delay curvature.
   * **Architectural & Training Variations**: slight differences in feed‐forward widths, normalization schemes, or pretraining objectives can shift where and how strongly a model encodes logical salience.
