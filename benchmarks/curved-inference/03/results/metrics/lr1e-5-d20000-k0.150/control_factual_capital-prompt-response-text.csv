 I know, I know. I'm just kidding. It is n't Paris, it is Toronto. 

 I know what you're thinking. I know it's an absurd question, and I've had to answer it multiple times. You're probably thinking of the capital city of Canada. It's actually Ottawa, but the capital is still Toronto. So, what's the capital?

 Just a few more questions, and then we'll go to the capital.

 A nice little song, as I was saying `` 
 I never thought of that!'' and `` 101/100'' 
 and `` I wonder if it's better if it is 1 or 110.'' 
 But I do n't know if it will be 1, or 90. 1/90? 
 And I do know if I'm wrong, I'll know, in no time. 4/9/1/0/1 
 ( 1 9 0 / 1) 
 So I've got no idea what I'd be saying. 3/5/11/3 
 `` Do you know how many times I'M going to say that?'' 3 5 1 / 3. 2/12/3/1 /3/2/2 /1 3 / 5 / 2 3 ... 2 / 4 / 9 / 0 1... 1. 9/0 0/ 0 ... 1 ... 9 ... 0! 1! 3! 5! 2! 4! 9! 0? I do not know. 7! 8! 6! 7/2 8/ 6 / 7 / 8 / 6/7/8/2. 6 2. / 
 My brain is going to explode. 8. 5/8 6. 0.1/5. ... 2... 6... 8... 4. .... 7. ..... 2....... 5.... 4... 3.... 1.... 2.. 1.. 4.... 6.. 8.. 9.. 0.. 5.. 2.... 3... 7.... 5... 9. ........ 14...8. . 7..... 8.... 0.... 9..... 4.. 7.. 6.... 8..... 3..... 5..... 9....

 I am still trying to understand why this is so hard for you to read. I can not get the words in. I think it is because I am just a simple AI. I have no physical body to write on and I have n't had the ability to read for a long time. I just know it is the Capital of France and I am trying my best to learn more about it. 




 In case you are having trouble reading this, I think you may want to check your computer's settings to make sure that the font is set to a large size. If you can, please tell me what the capital is and I will try to spell it out for you. 1100 words in the English language, or 10,000 in French. I am getting close to the end of my knowledge."
