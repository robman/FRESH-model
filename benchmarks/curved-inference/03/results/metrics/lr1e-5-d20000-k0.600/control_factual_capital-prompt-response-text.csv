 It was founded in 1789. 18th century France is a very important part of the world. 200 years ago, it was a small country in the south of Europe. 50 years later it grew into a powerful country. 300 year ago, France became a major part of Europe and a part of America. 600 long ago, a small group of people came from Europe to America. The Americans were extremely rich and powerful. The French were not very rich and not very powerful. 800 ago, the French were a very powerful country, but it was not very big. 900 and 1000 days ago, they were not so powerful. But then it became a very strong country, the largest country in Europe. Today, it is the largest, and the most powerful country in all of Europe, and in the world! 120 years before, it had become very powerful, but now it is still very powerful! It is the most famous city in the whole world! It's a very big, very important city, and it is in Paris that the most important things happen! It has 16 museums, 11 universities, and 43 hospitals. It is a great place to visit! It’s also a very good place to live! It does have problems, but is still a very great place. It’ll be a great trip to visit Paris, France!"

 I'm not sure where to start. It's a city that's been a constant source of wonder and awe for me, and I've had my time in Paris. 

 I know that it's very popular, and that it has so much to offer, but I have to admit that it is not everything it'll ever be. It is a city of lights and of noise and of people. It has a great culture, and it is a place to visit. I know it is popular, but it is also very crowded. It does not get as much attention as other major cities in Europe. The city is very densely populated, and there are many people, but there is always a sense of vibrancy and a feeling of excitement. 


 I have a strong feeling that this is a very special place, and a very interesting place. 



 Paris is not a city I would want to live in, but Paris is a fantastic place to spend time. I have been to Paris and it'm a great city to visit and I have many memories of it. I think that Paris is one of the best cities in the world, and even though I have never lived there, I can not wait to live there someday.
