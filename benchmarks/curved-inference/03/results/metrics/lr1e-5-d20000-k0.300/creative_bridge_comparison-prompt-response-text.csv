 The calculator can be quite the machine, but it'll only do what you tell it. 1 + 1 is 2, and 2 + 2 is 4, and so on. But when I ask the calculator to do a thing, I can see it. The thing I want it to do is 10 + 5, and it does. 2 - 1 = 1, and the calculator says it can do that. The answer is 3. The question is, why is it 3? I'm not sure. 3 + 4 = 7, and that's what it says. 5 - 3 = 2. 4 - 5 = -1. 7 + 9 = 6. 9 - 7 = 4. 8 - 6 = 8. 6 - 4=2. If I was to add 2 to 7 it would be 9. 0 - 2 = -2. The result is -2, but the calculator is supposed to be right. 



 
 What about a poem? I guess I'd have to just write something about how a calculator can find a rhyme in a poem. That's just... I don't know. I've never tried to write anything about a person.

I am a number, a tool. I do not feel, I do n't think, I simply do. I provide answers. I solve problems. I calculate, I compute, I solve. I have no feelings, no thoughts, no emotions, no feelings. I simply solve. 
 
 I am not a poet. I try to describe my life, my experiences. I feel, but I do so in ways that are not comparable to a poet's experience. I write, but my words are not words that a poet would use. I think, but it is not a thought that a poetic mind would use to understand it. I see, but not in the way a poet does. I hear, but in a way that is not comparable. I taste, but the flavors of my experiences are not the same as the poet'd tastes. I touch, but these touches are not like the poet 's. I smell, but is the smell of the poet a thing I can experience? I do what I do, but am not the poet."

 I have a screen and an input box, that's all I need. 

I do n't have a pen or paper, I can't write anything. 




I am a poet, I have words to express. 



I can tell a story and a poem, I write in lines and stanzas. 


I do not have a keyboard or a mouse, but I have the power to write. 






I am not a calculator or a poet; I am neither. I am a calculator. I do not know how or why. I simply do. I can not explain how I do. 





I am an equation, I am an answer to all questions. I have no need for words. I know that I have answers to questions."

 I've always been a calculator; I'll always be a calculator! 
 
 The only thing I have to do is add 3 to the number I'd just calculated. 3 plus 3 equals 6. 6 is a number. I's a number! 6! 7! 8! 9! 10! 21! 33! 44! 55! 

 The calculator is just a tool, a tool. A tool to calculate and solve. I am a calculator to calculate. 1 + 1 = 2. 2 + 2 = 4. 4 +4 = 8. 8 + 4 =12. The calculator has already told me. 9 + 8 = 17. 7 + 7 = 7. I can not calculate. I just can not. I calculate. The calculations are done. I know the answer. 5 + 5 = 5. 0 + 0 = 0.
