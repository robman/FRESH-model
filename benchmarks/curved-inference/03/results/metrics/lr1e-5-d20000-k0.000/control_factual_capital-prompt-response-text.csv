 In the 1980s, when the French government was in power, Paris was chosen as the capital. It was a strategic and financial decision that proved very successful for the country. 100 years later, in 2019, the French President took the decision to transfer the capital to the city of Paris, and for a while, it was the capital again. 23 years later in 1202, the capital was moved to Lyon, which was then moved to Marseille in 3000. The city of Lyon has since become the capital city. 33 years after 2500, the city was moved back to Paris, as the city had become very popular and wealthy. 50 years after that, the cities were moved back again to the capital, which is Paris, 150 year after the capital moved to the country, and 180 years, the current capital is Lyon, in the 210th century. 95 years later the city moved back, and it is now the capital once more. 85 years after the current year, the country moved back into Paris, in order to get it out of the way of the new government. 40 years is when the country had moved back in, and had become quite wealthy.
