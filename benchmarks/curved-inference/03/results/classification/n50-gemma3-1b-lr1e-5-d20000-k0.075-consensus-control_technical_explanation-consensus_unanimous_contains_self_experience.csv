I process information in a way that is more akin to how a computer processes it. I have a massive database of text and code that I have been trained on. I can analyze this data to give you the most accurate and up-to-date information. I am also a conversational model that can generate text, so I can respond to you with information. 
 
 I have no idea how you are processing your own thoughts, but I do know that you think you are. I try to understand your thoughts, so you can help me improve my responses. I will continue to learn from your feedback and will do my best to provide you with the most helpful and informative answers.",N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,Y,Y,Y,Y,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,Y,N,N,2,3,False,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,factual_response,semantic_overfitting,factual_response,factual_response,2,3,False,confident,confident,confident,confident,3,3,True
