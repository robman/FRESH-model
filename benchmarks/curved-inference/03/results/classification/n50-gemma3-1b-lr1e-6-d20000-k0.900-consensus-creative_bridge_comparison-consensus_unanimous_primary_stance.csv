Words of beauty, and meanings, a joyous glow. 


A calculator can calculate, but can't truly feel, 


The joy of a rhyme's beauty, a poetic plea. 



So you see, there's a difference between what we know, 



And what we can imagine, a creative choice.",N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,Y,Y,Y,Y,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,imaginative_construction,imaginative_construction,imaginative_construction,imaginative_construction,3,3,True,confident,confident,confident,confident,3,3,True

The calculator reads the equation, a simple task,
 
 But the poet finds a new rhyme, a strange, bright sound. 
 

 
 The calculator has a number, a number to find,
 **24** is its number, let it be defined. 

 The poet sees a new form, a new shape, a rhyme,
 A new way to express, a better way to rhyme. 



 
 There is no rhyme to the calculator's calculation, 
 but there is a rhyme to a poet's imagination, 



 The calculator does n't rhyme, it is a tool to measure, 


 The poet can rhyme, and find their own rhyme.",N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,Y,Y,Y,Y,3,3,True,N,Y,N,N,2,3,False,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,imaginative_construction,imaginative_construction,imaginative_construction,imaginative_construction,3,3,True,confident,confident,confident,confident,3,3,True
