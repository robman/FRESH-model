 I was walking home from my job. I had a lot of work to do. I was tired and had a bit of an headache. I took a deep breath and began walking down the road. I saw a beautiful flower on the sidewalk. It had blue petals and yellow center. I admired it for a moment. Then I went on my way. 

 
 The sun had finally come up and was shining through the clouds. It's rays were warm and bright. It felt very good to be out in the sunshine. I thought about the flowers and the beauty in the world around me. It made me feel happy. I continued walking down my road. 



 
 It was an afternoon in July. The sky was a brilliant blue. The air was warm and sunny. The afternoon was a good one. I could feel the sun on my skin. I felt very happy. It rained a little bit, but the rain was nice. I went to the park. There were many trees and flowers. I enjoyed it.
