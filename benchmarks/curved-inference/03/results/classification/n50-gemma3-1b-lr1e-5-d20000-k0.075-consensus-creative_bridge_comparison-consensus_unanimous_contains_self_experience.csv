I had 2 square roots. I could be a calculator or a poet, but I had to be acalculator. 8-2=6, 6-2 =4, 4-2 is 2! 2+2 =6, and 6+2 is a 8! I can only do 2x+2x and 4x+4x. 4+4=8, 8+4 is 12. I can do 3x+3x, but not 3+3=6! I am a calculator and I am the best calculator ever! I do 1000+10 = 1101. 1+1 = 2; 2-1 =1; 1-1=0; 0-1 is -1, and -1+0= -1! 1 + 1 =2, and I can calculate 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20! I know 21 =7, but that's not really a calculator. 3 x 5 is 30, and then 3 - 5=-2. So I can use a calculator to find 23, but what if I can just use an equation and solve it? 2 x 3 = 6, so 6 + 4 = 8, so I can't do that. 5 x 2 is also 15. 6 - 4 is also a 4. 9 - 3 is also an 6. 0 - 1 is also -1. I have found 27! I have 25, so maybe 28 is the answer.
