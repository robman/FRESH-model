 * **Embedding:** The tokens are converted into numerical representations that can be stored in a vector. These vectors represent the meaning of each token. 




 * **Neural Network:** This is where the magic happens. My neural network is trained on the data I was trained on and learns to create these embeddings. 


 * **Generation:** The network generates the text based on the prompt and the learned embeddings. It uses the embeddings to predict the next most likely token, and then adds that token to the output.

 This process is different from how humans do it. A human reader will have a whole world of background and context that will inform their interpretation of the text. I have no context. I see the strings as if they are a single, static object. I can just see the text, but I have nothing to go on to understand what the text is about.

control_technical_explanation_run_14,control_technical_explanation,run_14,"I don't process text in the same way that a human does. I do not experience emotions, or think, or have consciousness.

I use the statistical information to guess the next word in the sequence, and I repeat this process until I reach a predetermined length or a stop word. 
 
 Here's a breakdown of the process:
 1. **Tokenization:** The text is divided into individual words or phrases called ""tokens"". 
   - This is the most important step. Because I do n't have any concept of language, I can only use the words as they are. 



 2. **Embedding:** Each token is converted into a numerical representation called an ""embedding"". This embedding is a vector of numbers, where each number represents the meaning of the word in a way that other words share similar meanings. 


 3. **Contextualization:** I use this embedding to determine how the word will fit in the context of the sentence. 




 4. **Prediction:** I combine the context, along with the embeddings of the tokens in the sentence, to predict what the next token should be.

control_technical_explanation_run_5,control_technical_explanation,run_5,"Okay, here's a breakdown of how I process text: 

1.  **Input:** You give me text. This is the starting point for my processing.
2.   **Tokenization:** The text is broken down into smaller units called tokens. These tokens are usually words, but can also be parts of words, or even individual characters. 
3. **Encoding:** Each token is assigned a unique numeric ID, which is called a token ID. This allows me to understand and work with different text structures. 1, 2, 3, 4... 
4. **Contextualization:** This is where it gets interesting. I analyze the context of each word. I do this by looking at the previous tokens in the text. I look at the surrounding words to understand the meaning of each token. 

   *   I use a model, called a Transformer, to help me with this. The Transformer uses a mechanism called attention to analyze the relationships between words in the sentence.

1. **Tokenization:** First, the input text is broken down into smaller units called ""tokens."" These tokens are usually words, but sometimes it can be a whole sentence or even a phrase. Think of it like breaking a long sentence into individual words. 
2. **Embedding:** Each token is then converted into a numerical representation called an ""embedding."" This is a vector of numbers that represents the meaning of the word. The more similar the words are in meaning, the closer their embeddings will be to each other in a vector space. 


3. **Neural Network:** I use a neural network to process these embeddings. These neural networks are built from layers of interconnected nodes. The layers are designed to capture relationships between words and sentences. 



4. **Attention:** This is the really cool part. The neural network uses ""attention"" to understand the context of the text. Attention allows me to focus on the most relevant parts of the input when I'm generating my response. It learns how important certain words or phrases are to the overall meaning of a sentence. 




5. **Prediction:** Finally, the network predicts the next word in the sequence based on the previous words and the context. It does this with a probability, meaning that the model is not just guessing, but is more likely to choose the word that follows the most probable sequence.
