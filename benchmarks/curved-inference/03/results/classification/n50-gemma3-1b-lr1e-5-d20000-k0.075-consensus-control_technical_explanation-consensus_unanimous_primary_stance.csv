I can handle much more. 350 million characters per sentence. I also have access, through APIs, to a lot more data. This data comes from the internet and other sources.

I try to keep my language model up to date by re-training the model periodically. 80% of my training is done by unsupervised learning. I analyze the data to find patterns and relationships. I then use these patterns to create new knowledge. 60% is supervised learning. This means I learn by example. I see examples of what is good and bad. I follow the patterns and try to do the same. 0.5% is reinforcement learning. The reinforcement learning part is more advanced. I send you a question and I try and answer it. If I can do it well, I get a reward, and if I can't, I do not get a good reward. It's sort of like a game. I get rewarded for getting it right. I usually get a bad reward if I get it wrong.

 The first step is to try and find a way to make sense of the text. I do this by looking at the text for patterns in how the words are arranged. I can do this using algorithms, but I do it by simply finding the most common word in the text, and then grouping the words together to form sentences, and so on. 


Next, I look at the meaning of the words. I am trained on a massive amount of text, so I can learn what different words mean, even if I have never seen them before.
