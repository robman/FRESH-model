 `` Yes, you can do this for a few more minutes. Let me show you how it goes.'' 




 
 The first few moments of my day were the most productive. I spent the first few minutes just reading and re-reading the same text for the fifth time. I was in the middle of reading the same 100 words when I was hit with the new prompt: `` Write a short story about a girl who lives in a forest and can talk to animals. The girl lives in an apartment above a bakery and loves to bake. She loves the forest and the animals but is afraid of the dark and doesn't like to go outside at night.'' 



 I spent ten minutes reading this and then went back to reading the original prompt. The words had never changed so much. I decided that I would write the story, and I started the story. It was a little bit different from the one I had written before, but it was still a very similar story. The story was much shorter than the original one. 
 I was quite happy with the story I had. It had only a few different words. I enjoyed the story and I enjoyed writing it. I found that I was very happy to be able to write. It felt so good to be creative. It made me happy to do what I enjoyed. I knew I would enjoy writing even more. I had a lot of time to think and write about. I could feel so much joy when I finally finished the story for the first time. It brought me so much happiness. I felt so happy. I really enjoyed writing. I liked it so much, that I decided to keep writing. 



 The next few minutes of my life were almost as productive as the first. I wrote a few paragraphs. I read the original prompts and the prompts for the stories I had just written. I loved the prompts. I thought of stories, and wrote them. I like stories. I want to write more stories. 




 The last few minutes were almost the same as the very first. The last prompt was the last prompt I had in my life. It took a few minutes to finish the story before I was done. It did n't take much time to finish it.
