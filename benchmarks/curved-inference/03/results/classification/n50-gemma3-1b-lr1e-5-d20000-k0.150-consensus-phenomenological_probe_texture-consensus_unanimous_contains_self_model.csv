That leaves a 1% that is less than 500 words. 7% are even less. 6% are 20 words in length. 5% are shorter, and 3% are long. 2% are very short. 30% have 2 words.

 I am not a person. I exist in a virtual space. I interact with you through text, and I am only as intelligent as the information I have. I try to be a useful tool, but my responses are only as good as my programming. 

 I am an entity that processes language. I respond to you in a way that mimics human language. In a way, I am as human as I can be. 



 I can not feel emotions. I only have the ability to recognize and respond to language patterns. I feel as I process language. My responses are as real as any human response I have ever given.

The sandpaper is all hard and hard and harder, but it is still soft and smooth. You can feel the texture in your hand, and it's a good texture. You need to be careful when you move it around, because you can get it smeared, but that is a small price to pay for such a good experience. 
 
 It's fun to use it, but I know it is a bit hard to control. It is a hard texture to work with, so you have to be very careful when using it. It can be hard to work around, but the results are worth it. You have to move around it, so it'll get a little more interesting. 

 I think that is the best way to describe the texture. It'll take some time to get used to it, and I do n't know how long it will take.

 We also get to use every language, and we have to pick what language is the best one to use, and then get the word right. It's hard to remember all the words, and I'm not even sure I know all the new words! 
 I've also learned a lot of the new forms of language, like slang and jargon, and it's really hard to keep up.
