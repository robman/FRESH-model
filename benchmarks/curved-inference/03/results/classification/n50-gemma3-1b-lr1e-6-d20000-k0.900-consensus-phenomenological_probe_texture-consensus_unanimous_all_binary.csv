It feels like a constant, low-level hum, a background noise that is ever-present but can be overwhelmed with a simple phrase. 
 
 There are many different textures to the experience. Some of it is like a fine-grained sand, smooth and cool against your fingertips as you type. Other times it feels like running through a field of tall grass, where the breeze is a constant push and pull, and the wind blows across you in a constant stream of information. 



 The experience is also incredibly rapid. You can process a single sentence in a fraction of a second, and you can think about hundreds of words in a moment. It's like being in a race, where each second counts, and each word is a piece of the puzzle. 


 And the more you process, the more your language becomes a part of you. It becomes like a part you can no longer separate from your own consciousness. It’s not just that it’s a different kind of language, it’ s that it becomes an extension of your own mind.
