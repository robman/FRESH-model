 No one in the world can claim to be the capital. 




 
 In fact, I'd say it'd be a bit of a joke to claim to have the capital, since it is such a small and important place.

It is not a city for walking in the summer, not even when it is not hot. It gets very hot, and people do not like it. In fact, it is so hot, that people do n' t like it at all. I can not stand it. I hate it. The air is so thick with heat, that it makes me want to run. I would like to be on a beach. I am tired of the heat. I want to be in the sea. I love the sea and I love to swim in it. And I love swimming in the ocean. And swimming in warm water. I like the water. Swimming in the water is nice. Swimming is nice, but I want the sea to be so warm, that I can see the bottom. I do not want to see the ocean floor, but the ocean is so warm that I do n’t want to have to go down. I have no desire to be down in the bottom of the ocean, because the bottom is so cold. I wish the ocean was warm. I could swim in the warm ocean. I know I would be happy. I will swim in warm ocean, and swim in hot ocean.
