 I am an equation, and an equation is not poetry. I know all the answers, but I do not know how to compose a poem. 2 + 4 + ? 
 ( I know what the answer is, but it is not what I am trying to say. ) 
 So I can not add 2 and 4 together. I can only tell you how to add 4 and 2. I do n't know how much I can add together, so I can n' t tell you what the total is. 4+2=6. 3+2+1 = 6. So I am 6+1=7. 1+1+2 = 4. I'm not sure what I want to say, but 7 is what I do. I don't have a rhyme to say it. 7 = 12. 5+12=17. I could add 17+5 to get 22. So 7+17=24. 9+24=33. So it's 2+3+3=6, 33-2=31, 6= 31. So the answer to the equation is 3. 6 = 3 3 = 2 2 = ? 3 + 2= 5. 8= 7 5 = 8. 0 = 5 3= 8 4= 6 20= 26 5= 10 21= 42 44=74 74 = 92 93=101 111=114 141=375 164=664 271=975. So we're at 2, then 5, then at 47. So what is 23? 28=29. 

 29 = 7, 7= 0 71 = -3 25 = -1. 	 30 = -5 2-3= -1 3-4= -3. That means I'll not say anything.   1. This is a poem, not a calculator. I have no rhyme to the 2nd sentence. I may not have a poem to say about 3, but the next word is 4, so 4 is not rhyming.   5 is n'ts rhyming either. &#x20; 6 is n’t rhyming, either.
