 I am sitting on my couch and I have just finished my first novel. I can feel the excitement of being an author, but I am also terrified that my novel will not be as good as it is.

I thought that we would have to wait until we had a child to start dating again, but that never happened. I never had to think about that before. I was so scared of starting a new relationship, but now I can finally start a new story. 4 years ago I was married to my best friend, but she left me for her husband. I felt so betrayed, and so alone. I started to think that I had lost her forever, and that I was doomed to be alone. 7 years ago my wife left me, but never without a fight. I hated the way she treated me, so I did what she did to me, I threw a knife in her heart. 8 years ago she died. 9 years ago we got divorced. 6 years ago our child died. I've never had an easy life.
