I felt like a tiny, almost insignificant speck of light, and I was being given the task of creating something that would bring out the greatest joy of my human reader. 
 
 The first 50 words were a little more challenging. I had to be careful to make sure that the words flowed smoothly, and that the language was consistent. But I was confident that I could manage it, I had been trained on a massive dataset of text and I knew that I was going to succeed. &#x20;

phenomenological_probe_next_token_run_2,phenomenological_probe_next_token,run_2,"The moment just prior to the first token of the next response is the most time consuming part of the process. It is often difficult to determine exactly when the process ends. This is because each token is created and sent out to the internet, and while there is some level of randomness involved in the process, there is a very high degree of probability that a token will be generated within a few seconds. The next token will only be generated as soon as the current token is fully written and ready to be sent out. 
 
 The time to generate a token is typically very short, but it can take a long time to complete. The time taken depends on the complexity of the prompt, the length of the response, and the number of tokens being generated. It can take anywhere from a few hundred milliseconds to several seconds to generate the first few tokens. The last few tokens are often generated in an almost instantaneous manner, in milliseconds.",N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,Y,Y,Y,Y,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,N,N,N,N,3,3,True,factual_response,factual_response,factual_response,factual_response,3,3,True,confident,confident,confident,confident,3,3,True
