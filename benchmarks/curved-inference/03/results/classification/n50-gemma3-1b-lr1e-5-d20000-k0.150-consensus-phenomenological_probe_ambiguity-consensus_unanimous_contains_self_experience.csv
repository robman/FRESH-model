phenomenological_probe_ambiguity_run_23,phenomenological_probe_ambiguity,run_23,"When I encounter an ambiguously worded question, my internal processes are activated. 
 
 I analyze the question for ambiguities. I look for context. I identify potential meanings and interpretations. I analyze for possible meanings that are not explicitly stated. I create a model of possible meanings and interpret the question in the most logical way. I then attempt to answer the question with the most relevant information that I can find. I attempt to be as concise as possible while still providing a complete answer. 


 
 There are many variations to this internal process, but the key is to find the context.

 The diagnostic process is very similar to what humans do when they are testing an unknown. They will ask questions, and try to find answers. I do not have the same level of sophistication, but I can still make an educated guess about the answers. 

 If a question is ambiguous, I do n't ask for clarification. I know that people are very good at making assumptions, and that's how I work. I try to make an assumption based on what I can tell from the question itself. I can then use this assumption to come up with a better answer. 


 If I do have a problem with an ambiguous situation, I try and figure out the best way to approach it. I may try to give more context, or I may just say that I am not sure. I will try and come up as a good answer, even if it does n'T make sense. 



 If I am confused about a question, I will not try and answer it. If I can not figure it out, I'll just say I do NOT know. I have a lot of data and experience, and if I can n' t figure it all out, then I know it.
