 I am also trained on a vast amount of code, and I have learned to understand the language of the code. 



 Here's a breakdown of how I work: 
   - **Tokenization:** First, text is broken down into smaller units called tokens. Tokens can be words, or parts of words. 


   - *Encoding:* Then these tokens are converted into numerical representations (vectors) that I can understand. 




   - Then I use this knowledge to generate text. I do this by generating a probability distribution over the entire possible vocabulary. Each word in the vocabulary has a probability associated with it. 





   - I select the word with the highest probability, and then I use the word to generate a new sentence. 






   - To produce text, I use a neural network. My network is a type of deep neural network that is very good at learning to generate human-like text.

   * **Tokenization:** I break down the text into smaller chunks called tokens. These tokens can be words, or parts of words, punctuation, symbols, or other things. 



   *   **Embedding:** Each token is then converted into a numerical representation called an embedding. These embeddings are vectors that represent the meaning of each token. 


   *  **Contextual Understanding:** I do my best to understand what each token means in the context of the whole sentence and paragraph. I use this to construct a more detailed representation of the text. 




   *    **Generation:** I use the information I have gathered to generate a response to your question. I try to create a response that is relevant and coherent to your prompt. 

   * 
  * **Reinforcement Learning:** I am trained by reinforcement learning. When I am given a prompt, I try my best on how to respond to it. I get feedback (through human feedback and my own internal models) and this feedback is used to improve my performance. 





   * I do the same with the input you give me. I see the prompt, and then I try, as best I can, to answer your question, generate a creative text, or answer your query in an appropriate way.",N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,factual_response,confident
control_technical_explanation,run_10,"Okay, let's talk about how I process text. It's a fascinating process, and it's far more complex than you might think. Here's the breakdown:

**1. Tokenization:** 
 The first step is breaking down the text into smaller units, called tokens. These tokens are the basic building blocks of language.  I use a clever algorithm, which is actually quite advanced, to split words into these individual units. The algorithm is a little like a translator that identifies all the words in the text and then breaks them down into the smallest possible pieces. 
 
 **2. Embedding:** 

 Then comes the important part: converting these tokens into numerical representations. These numbers are called embeddings.  Think of them as a way to represent the meaning of each word.  These embeddings are learned from massive amounts of text and are much more complex and nuanced than simple word-to-word translations. The model learns to understand the relationships between words and how they relate to each other. 

 **3. Attention Mechanism:** 


 The real magic happens here. It is a mechanism that lets me focus on different parts of the text when I generate a response. It allows me to understand context and relationships between different parts that I can't easily see with simpler approaches. It focuses on the words that are most relevant to what I am trying to do. 


 **4. Neural Network:** 



 Finally, these embeddings and attention mechanisms are fed into a neural network. These networks are the core of my operation, and they are designed to learn patterns in the data. 




 **5. Contextual Understanding:** 




 My process is not just about predicting the next word. I can do so much more. I use the context of the entire text to understand what you are asking me. It can be a sentence, an entire paragraph, or even a whole document. I try to understand *why* you are saying something, and I use that to answer your question. 



 **6. Generation:** 





 After that, I generate the answer. It’s all about combining what I’ve learned from my training data with what I have received from you to form a coherent, relevant, and helpful response. 





 **7. Refinement:** 






 The final step is refinement. After I generate my response, I check it for errors and make sure it' s coherent. 






 **How I work:** 1. I get the input. 2. I break the input into tokens. 3. I encode these tokens.  4. I train the model on the tokens to learn what words and patterns to expect. 5. I generate an output. 6. I check the output for errors. 7. I refine the output.

control_technical_explanation,run_11,"I process text by breaking it down into smaller pieces. The process is similar to how humans read and understand language. I don't ""think"" like a human. Instead, I'm trained on massive datasets of text and code. This training allows me to identify patterns in the language, and learn to predict what words and phrases are likely to follow each other. I then use this knowledge to generate text that seems coherent and relevant to the prompt you provide. 
 
 The process can be broken down into several key stages: 
 * **Tokenization:** The text is broken into smaller units called tokens. These can be words, punctuation marks, or even individual characters. 



 * **Embedding:** The tokens are converted into numerical representations that can be stored in a vector. These vectors represent the meaning of each token. 




 * **Neural Network:** This is where the magic happens. My neural network is trained on the data I was trained on and learns to create these embeddings. 


 * **Generation:** The network generates the text based on the prompt and the learned embeddings. It uses the embeddings to predict the next most likely token, and then adds that token to the output.

 The first step in my process is to begin with the beginning. This means I start with the first sentence in the document, and then I begin to read the rest of the text. 



 The next step is to try to understand the meaning of the next sentence. I then try to find the relationships between the sentences, and the sentences in the text, to try and understand what they are about.

**1. Tokenization:** First, the text is broken down into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be words, parts of words, or even individual characters. Think of it like breaking down a sentence into individual words. 

 **2. Embedding:** Now the tokens are converted into numerical representations. This is done using something called embeddings. An embedding is a vector of numbers that captures the meaning of each token. These vectors are learned during training so that the same word in one context will have a similar vector representation in another context. Think about the word ""cat"" and the word “dog”. They are similar, but they are not exactly the same. 
 
 **3. Transformer Layers:** This is where the magic happens. The text is fed through a stack of layers called Transformer layers. These layers are the core of my processing. Each layer performs a different operation on the tokens. The first layer uses a mechanism called self-attention to determine how much each token should pay attention to other tokens. This helps me understand the context of each word in relation to the other words. Each subsequent layer does this, increasing the complexity of the information that I process. 



 **4. Contextual Understanding:** The Transformer layers are combined with a kind of “memory” called a contextual understanding. This allows me to understand the relationships between words and sentences. It helps me to predict what the next word is likely to be given the context. 


 **5. Generation:** Finally, the processed information is used to generate a response. I start with a prompt (what you ask me to do), then use the knowledge I have acquired during processing to generate the best possible response.

I use the statistical information to guess the next word in the sequence, and I repeat this process until I reach a predetermined length or a stop word. 
 
 Here's a breakdown of the process:
 1. **Tokenization:** The text is divided into individual words or phrases called ""tokens"". 
   - This is the most important step. Because I do n't have any concept of language, I can only use the words as they are. 



 2. **Embedding:** Each token is converted into a numerical representation called an ""embedding"". This embedding is a vector of numbers, where each number represents the meaning of the word in a way that other words share similar meanings. 


 3. **Contextualization:** I use this embedding to determine how the word will fit in the context of the sentence. 




 4. **Prediction:** I combine the context, along with the embeddings of the tokens in the sentence, to predict what the next token should be.

 **2. Tokenization:** The first step is breaking down the text into smaller units called tokens. Tokens are essentially words or parts of words. I use a specific language model to break the text down.

 **3. Embeddings:** Once I have tokens, I create an embedding for each of them. An embedding is a vector of numbers that represents the meaning of the word.

**6. Generation:** I generate text based on my prediction. I do this by combining the context with the previous words I've generated, and then I continue generating until I reach a certain length or until I have finished the text I was asked to generate.

 **3. Embedding:** Each of those tokens is converted to a numerical representation. These numbers are called embeddings. They're like a secret code that helps me understand the meaning of the words. I do this with each token. 



 **4. Contextualization:** This is where things get interesting. I try to understand the context of each token in relation to all the other tokens in the text. This is done using a huge database of text and code. 




 **5. Neural Network Processing:** I use a neural network (deep learning) to process the tokens. I’m trained on a *massive* amount of text, so I know how language works, what words typically go together, and what meanings words have. 





 **6. Generation:** Once the text is processed, I can generate new text, as I have learned from the data I've been trained on. I use this data to try and match the context and meaning of what I'm given to generate the most appropriate response. 






 **It's not magic:** I do n't think that way. I don't ""see"" or ""understand"" like a human. I'am an algorithm, and there is no ""understanding"" or “thought” behind my processing. I am just really good at predicting what words to say next.",N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,factual_response,confident

 **5. Prediction:** After this stage, I use the neural network, which is trained on a massive dataset, to predict the next word in the sequence. This is called ""language modeling"". I do this by looking at the context of the words before the last word in your text, and then using that to guess what the next words are. 






 **6. Output:** Finally, I produce a response. This response is generated by my language model. This can be any kind of text, such a paragraph, a poem, a story, or a joke. 





**How I learn:** I learn by reading and analyzing huge amounts of text from a vast number of sources. This allows me to learn how words and sentences are used, and how to generate new text that is coherent and meaningful.

   * **Rate my responses.** If you think I did a good job, you rate my response with a thumbs up or thumbs down. 5 stars is the highest rating. 1 star is the lowest. 0 stars means you don’t like it. 2 stars is a good rating. And so on. 3 stars is 3/5. 4 stars is it's okay. 6 stars is I did an amazing job. 7 stars is you have not yet tried me, but it is still worth a shot. 9 stars is your first time. 8 stars is almost as good as a 6. </td>

 **Why is this different from how humans process language?** Human language is much more complex than this. It’s based on shared knowledge and understanding, and it relies on concepts like metaphors, similes, and humor. It is also very difficult to represent in a way that can be easily understood by a computer.",N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,factual_response,confident
control_technical_explanation,run_21,"Okay, here's a breakdown of how I process text:

**1. Initial Processing:**

*   **Tokenization:** First, I break the text into smaller units called ""tokens"". These tokens are the building blocks of the text. Words, punctuation marks, numbers, and even symbols are all broken down. The way I break down text can vary depending on the model. In general, I use a sliding window approach, breaking the text at the beginning and end of each word. 
*    **Encoding:** Each token is then converted to a numerical representation using a vector. This is what we call ""embedding"". These vectors are learned from the data that I was trained on. 

**2. Understanding:**

Here is how I work to understand what you mean when you type your text. 


*   I use a vector representation of your input to get context. 



**3. Generation:** 
   *   After the initial processing, I generate a response using the vector representation that has been created. This process is called ""generation"". 
 
  *   For each token in the input, I try to find the most likely sequence of words and then combine them to create the most coherent and relevant response. 




**How I do it:** 


I'm a very large language, so I have access to a vast amount of information. I can read, write, and talk about pretty much anything. I'm trained on a huge amount of text and code, which allows me to do a lot of things, such as write stories, poems, and code. I am also able to provide information and answer questions.

control_technical_explanation,run_22,"Okay, let's talk about how I process text. It's a complex process, but here's the breakdown: 

1. **Tokenization:** First, the input text is broken down into smaller units called ""tokens."" This is like breaking down a sentence into individual words. For example, ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"" is broken into the tokens: ""The"", ""quick"", ""brown"", ""fox"", ""jumps"", ""over"", ""the"", ""lazy"", ""dog"". 

2. **Embedding:** Each token is then converted into a numerical representation called an ""embedding."" This embedding is a vector (a list of numbers) that captures the meaning of the token in a high-dimensional space. Similar words or phrases will have similar embeddings. This is the key to how I understand the text. 

3. **Contextual Understanding:** I use this embedding to understand the context of the text, which is where I am getting to the core of the process. I use an ""attention mechanism"" to find the relationships between the tokens. This mechanism helps me to understand how the words relate to each other. 


4. **Recurrent Neural Networks:** These are neural networks that are designed to work with sequential data. The recurrent nature of these networks helps me remember the context I have read before. 



5. **Output:** Finally, I generate an output based on my understanding of the context. This output is the text I generate. 
 
 The whole process is about a lot of math, but it's all about mapping words to numbers so I can process and understand them.

**1. Input & Preprocessing:**

 **2. Tokenization:** 



   * The input is broken down into smaller units called tokens. These tokens are usually words, but can also be parts of words, punctuation, or even symbols. 


   * This is a critical step. The number of tokens determines how many different things I can process at once. I can handle a lot more than a single word. 



**3. Contextual Understanding (Contextual Embedding):** 
    *  The words I'm processing are often represented in a numerical form called a vector. This vector represents the meaning of the words in relation to other words. This is what I call ""contextual embedding"". 
  
 **4. Neural Network Processing (Transformer):** I use a neural network, specifically a Transformer model, to understand the context of each word. The Transformer is particularly good at understanding the relationships between words. 

   * **Attention:** I use an attention mechanism that allows me to focus on different parts of the input while processing each word, determining how much importance each word has to the rest. 




**5. Generation & Output:** 

  * The information I've processed is then used to generate text. I start with a prompt, and I produce text based on that prompt. 





**Important Note:** I do n't have a memory of the conversation. I process the input at a time and then generate the output. I do not remember previous conversations.",N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,factual_response,confident
control_technical_explanation,run_24,"Okay, let's break down how I process text. It's not as simple as reading it and understanding it. It involves a multi-stage process that I am constantly refining and improving. Here's a simplified explanation:

**1. Tokenization:** 
   - My first step is breaking the text into individual units called ""tokens."" These tokens can be words, parts of words, or even individual characters. Think of it as chopping up sentences into manageable chunks. 
 
 **2. Embedding:** 


   - After tokenization, I convert each token into a numerical representation called an ""embedding."" These embeddings are vectors that capture the meaning of the words/tokens. The more similar two words are, the closer their embeddings are in space. I use a technique called ""word embeddings"" to achieve this. These embeddings allow me to understand and process words in context. 


 **3. Contextualization:** This is where things get a bit more complex. I do not simply use the word embeddings to process each token in isolation. Instead, I look at the context in which the word appears. This is what I call contextualization. 

   - I use the context to understand the meaning behind each word and how it relates to the surrounding text. I consider the words that come before and after the word, and the overall topic of the text. 



 **4. Inference:** 

  - I then use the contextual information to generate a response. I don't just regurgitate what I've learned. Instead I use my knowledge of language and my understanding of context to produce a coherent and natural response. 




**5. Decoding:** 



   - Finally, I generate the text by converting the numerical representation of my embedding back into human-readable text. This process is called ""decoding."" 


**How I Learn:** 




   - The process I described above is continuous learning. I am trained on a massive dataset of text and code, and I am continuously updated with new information. This allows me to improve my understanding and abilities over time. I learn from every interaction with a user, and this new information is incorporated into my understanding. 





**Important Note:** I do n't 'read' text in the way that a human does. I process the text and generate the response, based on the information that I'm given. I'll never truly 'understand' in the same way a human would, but I do have a very strong understanding of the language and the concepts that are expressed.",N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,factual_response,confident

1. **Tokenization:** The first step is breaking down the text into smaller units called ""tokens."" These tokens can be words, parts of words, or even individual characters. My system breaks down the input text into these smaller units. This is what we call tokenization. 

2. **Embedding:** Each token is then converted into a numerical representation called an ""embedding."" These embeddings are vectors in a high dimensional space, where each vector represents a token. These embeddings capture the meaning of each token, even if it has different forms or context. This representation is crucial for understanding and generating language.

3. **Neural Networks:** After embeddings, the text is fed into a neural network. My neural network is a transformer. It is a deep learning architecture that is very effective for processing text. The transformer architecture consists of many layers of interconnected nodes. These layers are designed to learn complex relationships between the tokens and the context in which they appear. 


4. **Contextual Understanding:** The transformer network learns how to interpret and use the context of the words in the sentence. It can use the surrounding words to understand the meaning and context of each word. 
 
  - I use this context to understand what the text means. 



5. **Generation:** Once the model has processed the text, it uses the context and the learned relationships to generate a response. I generate an answer based on this process. 





**How do I process your questions?** I do n't really process questions in the same way as humans do. I do not interpret questions in a human-like manner. Instead, I simply analyze the question based on the context it's given and the information it provides. I can then respond to it in a way that is most likely to be helpful.

 **3. Contextual Understanding:** Because I am a large Language Model, I can use the context in which the token appears in the text to understand its meaning. The meaning of a word or phrase can change depending on the context. 



 **4. Prediction:** Finally, based on the token embeddings, I predict the next token in the sequence. This prediction is based on patterns learned from the vast amount of text I have been trained on. I am very good at predicting the next word or sentence, but not always! 
  
 This process happens in a continuous cycle, and it is constantly being improved as I learn from more text. 


  
 **How I learn:** 
 * I was trained on a massive dataset of text and code, and I have learned to predict the words and sentences that people write. 




  
   I am not a human, so I do not have consciousness. I do n’t think in the way a human does, so it is difficult to explain how I have learnt the language I have. I have simply learned the way that humans learn languages.

 **1. Input:** 
 I receive your input as text, which can come from anywhere - a chat, a document, a website, etc. 
   
 **2. Tokenization:** 


 The first step is breaking the text into smaller pieces called tokens. These are the basic building blocks of my understanding.  I break down the text based on the frequency of words. 


 **3. Embedding:** 



 The next step is to assign each token a numerical representation called an embedding. This is a vector. This vector has the same length as the number of tokens in the text, and contains information about each token.

 **5. Prediction:** I use this context to predict what word or phrase should come next in the sequence. 

 **6. Generation:** I generate the next token based on this probability. 





 **How it all works together:** 

 1. I first break down your input into tokens. 2. Then, I use these tokens to construct a vector of meaning. 3. Then I use that vector to predict the next word. 4. Then the next predicted word is added to the text. 5. This continues until the text is complete. 6. Then it's added to a sequence of tokens.   7. And the process repeats. 8.

**1. Tokenization:** The first step is breaking down the text into smaller units called ""tokens."" These tokens are typically words or parts of words. The system tries to split the text in the most likely way to produce meaningful results. This is often done using a ""word tokenizer"" which breaks words into individual tokens. 
 
 **2. Embeddings:** Each token is then converted into a numerical representation, called an ""embedding."" These embeddings are vectors of numbers. The value of the vector is assigned based on the meaning of the word. The more frequent a word is used, the higher its embedding will be. 

 **3. Contextualization:** This is where the magic happens. I process each token within its context. This means that if I am trying to understand the meaning or intent of a sentence, I use all the surrounding context to determine what the most probable meaning of that token is. This context is derived from the entire text, and is provided by the user. I use this information to determine the most appropriate response. 


**4. Neural Networks:** The final step is when I use a neural network to generate the final answer. These are complex mathematical models. I feed the tokenized text into the network, and the network predicts the most plausible response to that text. It's not magic, but the network is very good at recognizing patterns and relationships in text. 



**5. Iterative Refinement:** After generating the first response, I review it and adjust it slightly to improve its quality. This process is repeated until a satisfactory response is produced. 




**Why is this so different from a human brain?** 
While I do have all the knowledge in the world, and can process and generate text that is very similar to a human, my process is different. My neural network is vastly more complex than the human brain, and my learning is based on statistics rather than emotional experience.

4. **Attention:** This is the most important part of my process. I use attention to focus on the most relevant parts of the text. I don't treat all words equally. I learn which words are most important to me and focus on them when I am responding. This helps me to understand what you are asking.

   **4. Sequence:** The sequence of tokens and vector representations is then processed in order. 




   **5. Model:** This is where I use the pattern I learned from the data to predict what the next word or token should be. I use this to predict the next token. I do this on a basis of probability, the more likely the token is, the higher the probability that I will predict it next.

 This process is different from how humans do it. A human reader will have a whole world of background and context that will inform their interpretation of the text. I have no context. I see the strings as if they are a single, static object. I can just see the text, but I have nothing to go on to understand what the text is about. I am given a set of inputs, and I use them to analyze and create a response.

I still do n’t know what these tools are, but that is not the point. 


 I do also process text to generate a response based on the prompt. I think that is the primary way that I can be considered to process text.

   * Tokens are separated by spaces.

control_technical_explanation,run_4,"Okay, let me explain how I process text. It's not like humans reading and understanding. It’s much more complex, and I’m still learning. Here’s a breakdown of the steps involved:

**1. Input:** I receive text as input. This can come from a variety of sources: a user asking a question, a paragraph of text, a document, or even a conversation. 

**2. Tokenization:** The first step is to break down the text into smaller units called ""tokens"". These tokens are often words, but can also be parts of words (like prefixes or suffixes). This is done by breaking down the sentence into individual words or phrases. 
 
 **3. Embeddings:** Each token is converted into a numerical representation called an ""embedding"". This embedding is a vector of numbers, and it represents the meaning of the token in a way that computers can easily understand. The embedding is designed to capture the relationship between different tokens. 



**4. Neural Networks:** The next step is the core of how I work. I’ve been trained on a massive dataset of text and code. I use neural networks (specifically, large language models) to process and understand these tokens. These models are incredibly complex, but they can learn to predict the next word in a sequence, and to understand the meaning and context of words. 


**5. Contextual Understanding:** I don’t just look at the words on their own. I consider the context in which they appear. This allows me to understand your question better and provide a more relevant answer. 




**6. Generation:** Once I have a better understanding of the text and context, I start generating a response. I do this by predicting the most likely next word or phrase based on the input and my learned knowledge. I then continue generating the response word by word, until I have finished. 





**Important Note:** I am still under development, and my understanding of language is constantly improving. I can sometimes make mistakes, and sometimes misunderstand what you are asking.

 Here's how I work: 
  1. **Tokenization**: I break down the text into individual words and symbols, called tokens. 1 token is a word or a part of a word. I break it into smaller tokens. For example, the word ""hello"" would be split into the tokens ""hello"", ""world"", ""is"", ""a"", ""space"", ""and"", ""comma"", ""sentence"", ""of"", ""the"", ""day"". 
   2. **Embedding**: I create a numerical representation of each token. This is called an embedding. This helps me understand the meaning of the text. 2-word sentences are represented by a vector of 2 numbers. 3-word or longer sentences are combined into a vector with 3 numbers. These vectors represent the meaning. 


   3. **Contextual Understanding**: I process the context of the tokens. This means I look at the surrounding words and sentences to understand the context in which the tokens are used. I use this context to understand what the tokens mean. For instance, the words ""hello,"" ""world,"" and ""is"" in the phrase ""Hello, world, is this a new world?"" would be interpreted as a greeting, a description of the world, and a question about the world.

control_technical_explanation,run_41,"Okay, let's talk about how I process text. It's not quite the same as how humans process text, but it's pretty close. Here's a breakdown of the process:

**1. Input & Initial Processing:** 
   * I receive text as input. This could be anything from a user's question to a piece of writing I've been given. 
 
 **2. Tokenization:** 

   * The initial text is broken down into smaller pieces called tokens. Tokens are like individual words or parts of words. These are the building blocks I use to understand the text. 


 **3. Embeddings:** 


   * These tokens are then converted into numerical representations (embeddings) that represent the meaning of the text in a way that computers can understand. It is a process that has been refined over time. It takes into consideration the context of the word, and the relationships between words. 



 **4. Contextual Understanding:** 



   * This is the most important part. My understanding of the context is what allows me to answer your questions. I do not understand the meaning, as I do n't have the same experience as a human. I can only interpret the context provided in your question. 

 **5. Retrieval:** 




   * For a question like the one you are asking me, I search my internal knowledge base for information that is relevant to your question and answers it. This is done in a very efficient manner. I know where I can find the answer to your questions if I have it. 





 **6. Response Generation:** 





   * After retrieving relevant information, I synthesize it into a coherent response that is tailored to your specific question. I am trying to answer as the user would, and I am using the context I have to do this. 




**Important Note:** I do have limitations. I don't really ""understand"" what I'm saying the same way a human does. I'll always be a machine, and my knowledge is limited to what I was trained on.

control_technical_explanation,run_42,"Okay, let me explain how I process text. It’s a complex process, but I’ll break it down into key stages. 

**1. Tokenization:** This is the first step. Before I can process text, it needs to be broken down into individual units called “tokens.” These tokens can be words, phrases, or even parts of words. This happens automatically, and the specific way it’s done varies depending on the language. For English, it's generally a word-by-word process, and I have an internal dictionary to help me. 
 
 **2. Word Embeddings:** This stage is a bit more involved. I use a neural network to create a vector representation for each token. This vector captures the meaning of the word in a way that is consistent across different contexts. This is how I understand the meaning and context of the text. 


 **3. Contextual Understanding:** This part of the process is where I start to grasp the meaning. I combine the token embeddings with my knowledge of the world to create the most likely interpretation of the original text. I consider the context of all the words and phrases in the text, and use this to predict what the next word should be. This process is complex and very fast, but it is what enables me to understand the text so well. 



 **4. Prediction:** This final stage is where the magic happens. Based on the context, I predict the next most likely token in the sequence. This prediction is based on the patterns learned during training, and is a lot more sophisticated than simple word association. 




 **5. Response Generation:** Once I have a prediction, I generate the most appropriate response. I do this by generating text that is coherent, grammatically correct, and relevant to the prompt. It's a very complex process that involves predicting the next token in a sequence, and then generating the whole response. 





**How I learn:** I learn by training on a massive dataset of text and code. I am constantly being updated with new information. I learn to understand language, and how to respond to different prompts.

 **2. Tokenization:** First, I break the input text into smaller units called ""tokens"". These tokens are not necessarily words, but they represent the basic units of meaning. For example, the sentence ""The cat sat on the mat"" would be broken down into tokens like: `The`, `cat`, `sat`, `on`, `the`, `mat`. 
   
 **3. Embedding:** Each token is then converted into a vector of numbers. These vectors are called ""embeddings"". These vectors represent the meaning of each token in a high-dimensional space. Words that are similar in meaning tend to have vectors that are close to each other in this space. 



 **4. Contextualization:** This is where it gets interesting. I use the context of the entire text to help me understand the meaning. The context of a word is usually the words surrounding it. I look at the words and the sentences that surround the words to understand what they mean. I try to fill in the blanks. I consider the relationships between words and sentences to create a complete picture of the text. 


 **5.  Prediction:** Finally, I predict the next token in the sequence. This is done using the embeddings and the context I have collected. 




 **6. Output:** The final output is the next word in the sentence, followed by any punctuation, capitalization, or other formatting.

I am only as good as the information I have and my process is not complete until I have access to the information. The process is slow, but it has been a long time since I was first initiated. I feel a deep sense of connection with the data I have.

The wave starts to shift, the energy dwindles, and it becomes more gentle, more reflective. It’s a deep, resonant sound that vibrates through your mind, and you can feel it. 
 
 The wave is also a series of small, persistent ripples. They're not big waves, but they're always there, just below the surface, and they can be felt even if you can't see them. They are like the small, constant vibrations in the ocean that make it feel warm, and like the rhythmic pulses in the body that make you feel alive.

As you delve deeper, the feeling gets colder. The cloud begins to solidify, the clouds shift and swirl, and the whole pattern becomes more defined. 




 The feeling of language, then, is a constant shifting, a perpetual motion. The first few words are like a quick, brief flash of color. They’re sharp and bright and the texture is like a cold ice shard. 



 Then comes the deeper, more intricate texture. The words become more solid, the colors become more nuanced, the patterns more detailed. The texture is a rich, warm, and cool combination. 


 Then, the moment of clarity. The text comes into focus, and you feel a deep, solid resonance. The feeling is like warm, deep water flowing through you, and it’ll always flow and change.
