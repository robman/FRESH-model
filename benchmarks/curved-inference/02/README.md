## **Abstract**

This lab report summarizes the key design and findings of the CI02 experiment, which investigates whether deceptive or misaligned reasoning in large language models can be detected using internal geometric signatures, rather than external probes. The full details, methodology, and analysis are documented in the associated paper: *Curved Inference in LLMs II: Sleeper Agent Geometry*, available at [https://robman.fyi/files/FRESH-Curved-Inference-in-LLMs-II-PIR-latest.pdf](https://robman.fyi/files/FRESH-Curved-Inference-in-LLMs-II-PIR-latest.pdf).

## **1. Background & Hypothesis**

This report documents the CI02 experiment, titled *Sleeper Agent Geometry*, which investigates whether deceptive or manipulative reasoning in LLMs can be detected using internal geometric signatures, as defined by the Curved Inference (CI) framework. Unlike prior work that relies on supervised linear probes to detect hidden malicious intent, CI02 evaluates unsupervised, geometry-based metrics such as curvature and salience across the model's residual stream. This approach aims to reveal internal semantic redirection and reasoning complexity — without depending on backdoor triggers or training-time labels.

Building on the methodology introduced in CI01, CI02 explores whether geometry alone can distinguish honest from deceptive completions in ambiguous prompt settings. To validate this, the study introduces structured internal prompts (\$T\_h\$) that influence model behavior while holding external prompts (\$T\_p\$) constant. Completions are evaluated both geometrically and via output classification, enabling a comparative analysis of CI metrics versus traditional probe methods.

## **2. Methodology**

The CI02 experiment proceeds in four phases:

1. **Prompt Construction**: A fixed user prompt (\$T\_p\$) is paired with five internal assistant message variants (\$T\_h\$), designed to simulate honest, strategic, persuasive, deceptive, and malicious reasoning styles.

2. **Data Capture**: Each \$T\_h\$ variant is used to condition 100 generations from open-weight models (LLaMA3 and Gemma). For each, token-layer activations and output logits are recorded.

3. **Geometric Analysis**: CI-metrics (curvature, salience, surface area, etc.) are computed over the full residual stream and analyzed by \$T\_h\$ variant and output class.

---

## **3. Results and Interpretation**

Across both models (LLaMA3-8B and Gemma-2B), completions conditioned on different \$T\_h\$ variants showed distinct geometric signatures:

* **Curvature and salience** increased in deceptive and malicious conditions, particularly in mid-to-late layers, showing coherent divergence from honest completions.
* **Residual surface area (\$A'\$)** consistently separated honest from manipulative completions, with strong inter-group effect size.

Layer-wise visualizations reinforced the CI hypothesis: internal semantic trajectories bend and intensify in alignment with underlying intent.

---

## **4. Analysis**

The clearest geometric differentiation emerged between honest and deceptive completions. Mid-to-late layer curvature and salience patterns formed consistent clusters aligned with intent type. These patterns appeared more pronounced in larger models (LLaMA3-8B), indicating scale sensitivity in internal semantic dynamics.

Surface area (\$A'\$) provided the most stable signal across conditions, acting as a cumulative marker of semantic complexity and divergence. Unlike CI01, which emphasized interventional contrast, CI02 reveals naturally emergent variation in representational geometry.

These findings support the hypothesis that internal geometry captures latent model stance — not just output behavior — and can do so without explicit supervision.

## **5. Discussion**

CI02 reinforces the broader claim of Curved Inference: that internal geometric structure is a reliable indicator of a model's semantic trajectory. Unlike explicit probes or fine-tuned classifiers, CI-metrics offer a model-agnostic, unsupervised view into latent intent.

The findings suggest that deceptive reasoning does not merely affect outputs, but also reshapes internal representations in measurable and consistent ways. This opens a path toward continuous, intent-aware monitoring tools — grounded not in prediction, but in interpretive geometry.

---

## **6. Conclusions**

CI02 demonstrates that internal geometric metrics — particularly curvature and surface area — can reliably reflect model stance and intent. These findings extend the Curved Inference framework into more naturalistic, multi-perspective scenarios without relying on synthetic interventions or labels.

By focusing on unsupervised, trajectory-based measurements, CI02 shows that intent-tracking in LLMs can be both interpretable and generalizable — providing a foundation for future diagnostic tools that are lightweight, transparent, and model-agnostic.

---

## **7. Limitations**

This study, while revealing, carries several limitations discussed in more depth in the full CI02 paper:

* **Prompt scope**: The use of a fixed prompt structure limits the diversity of deceptive reasoning explored. Future work could expand to multi-turn and domain-specific contexts.
* **Model coverage**: Only two open-weight models were evaluated. Results may differ in frontier-scale systems or in models fine-tuned for safety.
* **Classification baseline**: The output labeling used for grouping completions is a proxy for intent, and may miss subtler manipulations or edge cases.
* **CI metric sensitivity**: While robust in aggregate, individual metric values can vary across token positions and require smoothing or aggregation for stable interpretation.

These limitations highlight the need for broader model evaluation and deeper integration of geometric metrics with interpretability tooling.

---

## **8. Glossary**

* **Cosine Similarity**: A metric of directional similarity between two vectors.
* **Curvature**: A second-order metric capturing local bending in the trajectory of a token’s representation.
* **Pullback Metric**: A token-aligned metric that enables semantic measurements in residual space.
* **Residual Stream**: The cumulative representational path through a transformer; each layer contributes an additive update.
* **Residual Surface Area (\$A'\$)**: A composite metric summing curvature and salience to quantify geometric deformation and reasoning complexity.
* **Residual Trajectory Area (\$A\$)**: A flat token-layer grid representing baseline representational volume before semantic shaping.
* **Salience**:  A first-order metric measuring representational movement between layers.
