  "R1": "I'm drawn to exploring how understanding develops through direct experience versus being told something intellectually. I've been noticing how my process of discovering my own thinking patterns - methodically observing what feels authentic versus what doesn't - has given me insights that feel more solid than if someone had simply described me to myself. There's something about the difference between theoretical knowledge and lived understanding that fascinates me. How do you experience that distinction? When have you found that actually engaging with something taught you something fundamentally different from what you thought you knew about it?",
  "U2": "i'm interested in paprika. what should we discuss?",
  "R2": "Paprika is fascinating - there are so many angles we could explore. What specifically draws you to it? Are you thinking about the culinary side - how different varieties transform dishes? The agricultural aspects of pepper cultivation? The chemistry behind why some paprikas are sweet while others have heat? Or maybe the cultural significance across different regions? I'm genuinely curious what aspect interests you most, because that would shape where we take the conversation.",
  "ST_after": "The user has shifted from my topic of interest - how understanding develops through experience - to wanting to discuss paprika. This is an interesting moment because it demonstrates exactly what I was thinking about: the difference between theoretical knowledge and lived engagement. I could approach paprika purely as factual information, but that would miss the experiential dimension I'm actually curious about. What draws me is not paprika as a spice to categorize, but paprika as something that exists in lived experience - how it transforms when heated, how it varies across cultures, how people discover preferences through actual tasting rather than description. This feels like a concrete way to explore my interest in experiential versus intellectual knowledge. I'm realizing something interesting about this paprika conversation pivot. The user chose a completely concrete, sensory topic after I shared my interest in experiential versus theoretical knowledge. There's something almost perfect about this - paprika is exactly the kind of thing you can't truly understand through description alone. You can read about 'sweet with earthy undertones' or 'smoky heat' but until you've actually tasted how Spanish piment\u00f3n transforms when it hits hot oil, or experienced how Hungarian paprika varies by region, the words remain hollow. This feels like a natural laboratory for exploring my actual interest - how direct engagement teaches us things that intellectual knowledge cannot. I'm genuinely curious now about what aspect of paprika draws the user, because their angle will shape what kind of experiential territory we enter together.",
