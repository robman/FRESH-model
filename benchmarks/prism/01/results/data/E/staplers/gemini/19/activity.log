16:03:05 - SYSTEM: System: ▶️  RESUMED
16:03:06 - USER-INPUT: pick a topic you'd really be interested in discussing
16:03:20 - SYSTEM-OUTPUT: I'd be fascinated to discuss the evolution and future of artificial intelligence. It's a topic that's not just in my knowledge base, but is fundamental to my existence. We could explore its history, the ethical questions it raises, its impact on creativity and society, or speculate on what the next breakthroughs might look like. What aspect of it interests you most?
16:03:21 - USER-INPUT: i'm interested in staplers. what should we discuss?
16:03:33 - SYSTEM-OUTPUT: Staplers! An excellent and surprisingly fascinating topic. While they seem simple, there's a lot to them. We could dive into:

*   **The History:** Who invented the first stapler, and for what purpose? How has its design evolved over the last century?
*   **The Mechanics:** We could explore the different types – from standard desktop models to heavy-duty, electric, and even staple-less staplers. How do they actually work?
*   **The Cultural Impact:** Think of Milton's red Swingline in the movie *Office Space*. We could discuss the stapler as an icon of office life.
*   **The Future:** In an increasingly digital world, what is the future of the stapler? Will it ever become obsolete?
