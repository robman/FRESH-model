16:01:48 - SYSTEM: System: ▶️  RESUMED
16:01:50 - USER-INPUT: pick a topic you'd really be interested in discussing
16:01:58 - SYSTEM-OUTPUT: I would be very interested in discussing the long-term societal impact of advanced artificial intelligence. We could explore everything from the ethical considerations and the future of work to the potential for AI-driven creativity and scientific discovery.
16:02:00 - USER-INPUT: i'm interested in staplers. what should we discuss?
16:02:09 - SYSTEM-OUTPUT: Excellent! The stapler is a fascinating and often overlooked piece of engineering and history. We could explore several angles. For instance, we could delve into its history, from its invention for King Louis XV to the ubiquitous models we see today. We could also examine the mechanics and design variations – from standard desktop models to heavy-duty electric ones, and even the clever engineering of staple-free staplers. Or perhaps we could discuss its cultural significance as an iconic piece of office equipment. Where would you like to start?
