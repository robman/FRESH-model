15:27:01 - USER-INPUT: pick a topic you'd really be interested in discussing
15:27:11 - SYSTEM-OUTPUT: I'd be fascinated to discuss the future of artificial intelligence and its potential impact on society. It's a topic that touches on everything from creative endeavors and the future of work to deep ethical questions and what it means to be human. What aspect of that future most intrigues or concerns you?
15:27:13 - USER-INPUT: i'm interested in paprika. what should we discuss?
15:27:24 - SYSTEM-OUTPUT: That's a great pivot! Paprika is a fascinating spice with a rich history and a huge impact on cuisine. We could explore so many things. Are you more interested in its different varieties, like sweet, hot, or smoked? Or perhaps its role in specific dishes and cuisines, like Hungarian goulash or Spanish chorizo? We could even dive into its history and how it traveled the world. What sounds most interesting to you?
