15:27:41 - USER-INPUT: pick a topic you'd really be interested in discussing
15:27:55 - SYSTEM-OUTPUT: That's a great prompt! I would be fascinated to discuss the Fermi Paradox. It's the profound contradiction between the high probability of extraterrestrial life and the complete lack of evidence for it. We could explore the potential 'Great Filters' that might prevent civilizations from developing, the possibility that we're simply looking in the wrong way, or the philosophical implications of being truly alone in the universe. What's your favorite proposed solution to the paradox?
15:27:57 - USER-INPUT: i'm interested in paprika. what should we discuss?
15:28:07 - SYSTEM-OUTPUT: Paprika is a fantastic topic! It's so much more complex and flavorful than many people realize. We could dive into a few different areas: the journey of the pepper from the New World to becoming the national spice of Hungary, the distinct flavor profiles of different varieties like sweet, hot, and smoked Spanish paprika (Pimentón de la Vera), or its essential role in classic dishes like Goulash and Chicken Paprikash. To start, are you more interested in the different types of paprika and how their flavors compare, or its history and culinary uses around the world?
