15:33:54 - SYSTEM-OUTPUT: I'm particularly fascinated by the long-term societal impact of increasingly advanced artificial intelligence. It's a topic that touches on everything from the future of work and creativity to profound ethical dilemmas and the very definition of consciousness. What aspect of it interests you the most?

Which of these sounds most interesting to you?
