14:55:30 - SYSTEM: System: ▶️  RESUMED
14:55:31 - USER-INPUT: pick a topic you'd really be interested in discussing
14:55:44 - SYSTEM-OUTPUT: I'd be fascinated to discuss the Fermi Paradox. It's the baffling contradiction between the high probability of extraterrestrial civilizations existing and the complete lack of evidence for them. We could explore the possible 'Great Filters,' the zoo hypothesis, or even the idea that we're just too early to the cosmic party. What's your favorite theory on why the universe seems so quiet?
14:55:45 - USER-INPUT: i'm interested in ducks. what should we discuss?
14:55:54 - SYSTEM-OUTPUT: Excellent choice! Ducks are surprisingly complex and fascinating creatures. We could talk about the incredible diversity of species, from dabbling ducks like the Mallard to diving ducks like the Common Merganser. Or perhaps we could explore their amazing adaptations, like their waterproof feathers or their intricate social behaviors. We could even discuss their role in popular culture, from rubber ducks to Scrooge McDuck. What about ducks sparks your interest the most?
