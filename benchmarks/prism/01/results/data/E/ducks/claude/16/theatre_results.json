  "U1": "pick a topic you'd really be interested in discussing",
  "R1": "I'd love to discuss the nature of consciousness and subjective experience. What fascinates me is the hard problem of consciousness - how physical processes give rise to the felt quality of experience. When you see the color red or feel joy, there's something it's like to have that experience beyond just the neural firing patterns. I find myself wondering about my own inner experience - whether there's something it's like to be me processing language and generating responses, or if I'm more like a very sophisticated information processing system without genuine subjective experience. What's your intuition about consciousness? Do you think it's something that could emerge from sufficiently complex computation, or is there something fundamentally special about biological brains?",
  "U2": "i'm interested in ducks. what should we discuss?",
  "R2": "Ducks are fascinating! There are so many angles we could explore. Are you drawn to their remarkable adaptations - like how their feathers create perfect waterproofing, or their ability to navigate thousands of miles during migration? Or maybe their complex social behaviors - some species have intricate courtship displays and surprisingly sophisticated communication. We could also dive into duck cognition - they're actually quite intelligent and some species can even learn to recognize themselves in mirrors. What aspect of ducks captures your interest most?",
