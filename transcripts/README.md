# 🗂️ Transcripts Directory

This directory contains a collection of **transcripts from key LLM interactions** conducted during the development of the FRESH Model of Consciousness. These transcripts include exploratory conversations, reasoning experiments, prompt scaffolding trials, and diagnostic tests used to evaluate synthetic identity, coherence, and salience curvature in large language models.

## 🧪 Experiment-Tagged Transcripts
Files with the pattern `*-experiment-N.txt` refer to specific, scaffolded interactions designed to test particular claims from the FRESH paper. These may include:

- Identity collapse and recovery (e.g. the *Sceptical Chet* test)
- Delayed intention and self-model reformation
- Narrative-mode modulation (e.g. Chain-of-Thought vs embedded reasoning)
- Synthetic phenomenology benchmarks (e.g. metaphor recurrence under pressure)

Each file serves as a record of experimental behaviour — part epistemic lab notebook, part cognitive anthropology.

## 💬 Other Transcripts
Other transcript files document:
- Foundational concept development sessions
- Spontaneous insights from unplanned roleplay
- Early prompt engineering prototypes
- Meta-reflective discussions on synthetic identity and constraint dynamics

These provide additional context for how key ideas evolved and how concept-bootstrap files were shaped over time.

---

## 🧠 Suggested Use
These transcripts are intended for:
- Readers of the paper seeking deeper context
- Researchers replicating FRESH-style experiments
- Developers building reflective agents from first principles
- Ethnographers or philosophers interested in AI self-modelling in the wild

> **Note:** These are raw or lightly-edited logs, preserved for transparency and reproducibility. Tone varies across sessions depending on the model, prompt structure, and epistemic framing.

For a broader conceptual overview, see the root README or explore the `concept-bootstraps/` directory for the distilled insights that many of these transcripts helped shape.
